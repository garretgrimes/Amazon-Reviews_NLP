# Amazon-Reviews_NLP
This was a review and analysis of Amazon product reviews using two datasets. One dataset was labeled reviews (had star ratings) and the other did not have star ratings. Two methods were analyzed to predict the star ratings on the unlabled set. The first was using logistic regression (trained on the labeled data) and the other was using NLTK's Sentiment Intensity Analyzer.
