1,B003VZCZ0O,AJCK6OKNWGIYG,Mike K,1295222400,Love this cereal,I love cereal in general and Lucky Charms is up there as one of my favorites. I like my cereals a little sweet and Lucky Charms is just that. It's not too sweet. I love the marshmallows. I think they are the best marshmallows in any cereal that has them. I also like the fact that this cereal doesn't get that soggy after being in the milk for a little while. The taste is great and I can't get tired of it like some other cereals.

3,B000F4H5F4,A3G7HH7DU27DKN,mlm,1260230400,"Good, but very finely cut...","Twinings English Breakfast tea is a good, basic black tea (as is its stronger cousin, Irish Breakfast tea). But I find this loose tea to be a bit of a challenge. It is cut quite finely and no matter how fine the mesh on the infuser or strainer some of this always comes through. I drink a lot of tea and am fine with drinking some tea dust or even a few leaves, but I am talking about a lot of tea here...a teaspoon full or more in each cup.<br /><br />It is true that this tastes better than the bagged variety of Twinings English Breakfast tea. It is smoother and never bitter, as the bagged tea sometimes is. I have compromised and used the loose tea but I strain it through a coffee filter. The tins the tea comes in keep it quite fresh and though straining it is a hassle, it is worth it for me.<br /><br />This is moderately strong (I drink it black) and if you are sensitive to caffeine you might not want to drink it near bedtime. I use Amazon's Subscribe and Save program for this tea; it is a good bargain and I like the convenience of having it delivered. It is also hard to find the loose tea in supermarkets."
4,B000E7WM0K,A3NITES609Z2LN,Jenn L,1235865600,Now containing gluten!,"A year or so ago, I use to buy these quite often because they were gluten-free.  Last month I decided to order some again and this product no longer says ""gluten-free"" on the packaging and contains wheat.  I didn't want them to go to waste, so I ate one anyway.  I became very sick.  I do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat.  Just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheat/gluten."

I bought La Tourangelle (how do you pronounce Tourangelle?) pistachio along with hazelnut and a couple of other nut oils. I now like the zing of my salad much more. My only complaint is that the bottle is a flimsy metal, and it bent in the shipping. However, it is still fresh and useable."
6,B000255OIG,AYS3F0L3VFP6G,Regan,1297900800,Great training treats!,"Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering - a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!<br /><br />Also, being as they're only beef liver, I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.<br /><br />Highly recommended."

Fondarific fondant is amazing! It takes color very nicely, I use Wilton's gel colors, and is very easy to work with. It's a little hard when you take it out of the container, but I just pop it in the microwave for 10seconds and it becomes soft enough for me to work with.<br />This fondant tastes soooo good! Like cotton candy. Delicious!!<br />I made a 3 tier birthday cake using this stuff and I still have some fondant left over.<br />My tiers were 10"", 8"" and 6"". The first two tiers were 4"" tall and the 6"" tier was 8"" tall. I also used this for decorations.<br />Everyone at the party loved it!"

Scent, after all, is a huge part of taste, and this was disappointing.<br /><br />Even though I added more coffee grinds than the directions instructed, I found the coffee to be a bit bland. The taste was more than flavored water, but not amazingly so, with no subtle overtones. It wasn't bitter, but it wasn't much of anything.<br /><br />While I generally drink hi-test as opposed to decaffeinated, I do drink decaf at least twice a week. The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4"">Melitta</a> was comparable to the generic brand that I usually have.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4"">Melitta Cafe Collection riviera Sunset Decaf</a> isn't a bad coffee, but it's not worth the money if there are other options available."

15,B0089SPDUW,A2TJG4N8LNJW23,Blythe Dresser,1327104000,Smooth and tasty and an absolute dream come true for those who enjoy bold dark roasts...,"Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G"">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPLI"">Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>), I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups.  They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.<br /><br />I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.<br /><br />Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.<br /><br />I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try."

The liquor is a light honey color, and the apricot overtones are pronounced on the palate.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys green (or white)teas; wants to become more familiar with them, or as a gift for someone."

You can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips (or any food! LOL) as you see fit.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products. In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together.

I didn't realize it was the cause until the second time I fed them to her.  It's really bad because it doesn't cause the cat to throw up all at once.

Tangerine, orange and acerola (type of wild cherry) round out the other fruit juices. For my taste, this is not citrusy enough. I find an Orangina to have better flavor, but it is loaded with added sugars (high fructose corn syrup is the second ingredient in Orangina)! I also compare this to the Izze version and the Izze wins for flavor. I think the health benefits of The Switch or Izze drinks outweigh the flavor differences though, and if I was but one of these types of drinks, I would not look at Orangina again."

When the box arrived I opened it and tried the marmalade right away... but it was a huge disappointment.  First, it is no a true marmalade it is a jelly. I am attaching two pictures where you can see maybe a couple of lemon zest strips in the entire 454 gram (16 oz).  Second the jelly is soooo very sweet. There is not enough tartness I expected from a lemon marmalade. Third it had a weird texture, it left what I would describe as an oily feel in my mouth unlike any other jelly I have tried.<br /><br />List of ingredients:<br />Sugar 62g per 100g<br />Glucose-fructose syrup<br />Lemons<br />Gelling Agent: Pectin, Citric Acid<br />Acidity Regulator:Sodium Citrate<br />Flavoring: Lemon Oil<br />Color:Caramel E150C<br /><br /> Price with shipping slightly over $11.<br /><br />I eat a lot of different jams. I like having jam with my tea.  I will not be able to eat this jelly with my tea because I really did not like so many things about it. I will try cooking with it, maybe it will work on a chicken as a sauce.  I am so disappointed!<br /><br />8/22/11 Update<br />Normally I would not comment on a specific seller on a product review, but I think in this case it is relevant.<br />Enclosed with the marmalade was FoodIreland 100% satisfaction guarantee flyer with a contact email.

However, these little gummy gels do nothing as compared to the Stinger Honey Packs. If you are a road or mountain biker and need a good burst of quick energy to keep from bonking on that last hill, these will not help. In fact, the only benefit that I (or any of my riding buddies) have found is that they make your mouth water.

Now add ~3/4 oz Christian Brothers VS Brandy. (Optionally) garnish with whipped cream or a small accent of vanilla ice cream and serve.<br />Notes: Not to be a brand whore, but Christian Bros (VS, not the more expensive VSOP) is the only brandy I've found to really have the right profile for this recipe. Exact proportions for all 4 ingredients should ultimately be to your own taste. Non-fat and 1% milk are NOT recommended. The brandy should contribute its flavor but not be so strong as to have an obvious alcoholic note. I've for many years used a 1.0 Mocha + 1.5 Hazelnut ratio, but lately the Mocha product hasn't seemed as intense, so I've adjusted. You'll know it's right when the mocha + hazelnut + brandy flavors are in such balance that none is too dominant -- the result will be a new experience ""greater than the sum of its parts."""

It seems to bake just fine and if you need to be soy and dairy free I highly recommend it.

I love the rich buttery-ness of it. In my drinking days, butterscotch schnapps was my go-to drink. I love it. Mix it with a bit of milk or hot cocoa...oh yes. The best, though, is around the holidays, mix a touch of it into egg nog. Ooooh, now that's an idea, egg nog matcha. Red Leaf Tea, I will love you forever if you develop an egg nog matcha by the holidays! I can't have real nog any more, so I've been hunting for a good tea substitute.<br /><br />Anyway, yes. Butterscotch is love for me. It's another Dad memory, he loves it and it makes me think of him...or maybe I'm just homesick this week. Butterscotch pudding is the only pudding I'll touch and if an ice cream shop offers butterscotch topping, I'll risk the dairy allergy to get a cone covered in the stuff. Liquid gold, it is. And seeing the success of Red leaf Tea's Caramel and French Vanilla flavors, I have complete confidence in this blend being amazing. I think this definitely calls for a hot tea latte, despite it being stupidly hot outside. Am I in Toronto or back in Tennessee? These hot days are killing me...I should be able to handle them better!<br /><br />No, I went for a cold matcha instead, it's too hot out there to bother with hot drinks, though this one was made to be enjoyed hot. Hot with a touch of rum and milk. Mmm...anyway. Yes. Cold, it's less than stellar, but it's still yummy. Very buttery and rich, but not too rich. I want to sip on this all day, but I need to save some for when it's cool enough to be able to handle a hot drink. It does taste like candy, but it's not overwhemingly sweet. It's just tasty.  I'm not wowed by it like I am with some of their other blends, though. This one's good, but I need to try it a few more times before I decide if I'm going to keep it on my shelf or not. Perhaps a warmer water temperature will help, or a better ratio of tea to water. Still, it won't be hard at all to convince myself to drink this one! I might even be convinced to share it."

Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4."

127,B001PO7FIU,A1KK66VC8S9OMP,K. Hedges,1300924800,UPDATED: RECIEVED RANCID OIL,"I recieved this oil last week and it is rancid. It smells and tastes like rotten tomatos or avacados and there is no way I could eat this on any type of salad. Both cans arrived in perfect condition and neither are near the expiration date on the bottle. I recommend purchasing from a local retailer so it can be taken back if its rancid. Its too much of a gamble buying from Amazon when you cannot return food items. Lesson learned.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/05/2011: After reading so many reviews about how good this product was I contacted La Tourangelle through their email system and told them about the situation and asked how this avocado oil was supposed to taste. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to taste the way it did or not. I didn't ask for replacements or anything because I know a lot of companies will not back their product if sold by Amazon. That is not the case with La Tourangelle. I was contacted by Diane through email about a week later asking for the batch numbers. I gave them and didn't hear anything back, until today. About an hour ago UPS delivered a box that contained two large cans of oil; one can of Avocado oil and one can of Hazelnut oil. I was so surprised because I didn't even remember giving them my address, but now recall it was required on their email submission form. At any rate La Tourangelle went above and beyond and they will be getting my business in the future, but only in a B&M store or through their website. That is the only place I can recommend anyone buy these products because Amazon will not take back food items.<br /><br />As far as the oil, the new Avocado oil tastes like real Avocados with no rancid taste or smell and the Hazelnut is out of this world. I plan to try them all out now, from the La Tourangelle website. Companies that go above and beyond will always get my business because they actually care about their product. Thank you La Tourangelle!"

A couple of years ago I decided to go for it...make loose tea, and deal with mess of leaves.  And yes, I did know about strainers and tea balls, but I live in no man-s land.  If it isn't prepackaged, it's unfit to ingest according to the natives.  Good utensils are hard to find.<br /><br />I finally found a wonderful BIG mesh tea ball.  Ahhh, a tea drinker's best friend, right after a good English teapot.<br /><br />The mesh ball in question is like the one sold here as a rule, by the way.<br /><br />Tea is now a breeze to make, and absolutely delicious.<br /><br /> The loose packaged tea put out by Lipton is wonderful.  It has a beautiful taste, unlike their teabags, which can be very iffy.  I've had some that tasted like floor sweepings.<br /><br />This loose tea seems amazingly consistent in flavor.  I recommend it without reservation. And isn't Amazon just lovely...?  They'll bring it right to your door.  How much more could you ask?<br /><br />Earlier I mentioned an English teapot.  I favor Sadler's because of the excellent glaze, and the good material they use in the functional brown teapots they make.<br /><br />A good teapot matters.  Get yourself one, a nice tea ball, and some Lipton Loose tea and you will likely never use teabags again.  If the tea is too strong, do it the way it's done in England; keep a very lightly boiling kettle going, and dilute with boiling water to your taste."

Because Switch is not as carbonated as soda, it does not need to have added sugar, a definite plus.  The lower carbonation also makes it easier to drink.

As such, it's about as sweet and flavorful as regular juice. The sparkling water gives it a little different sort of fizz from regular soda's. Although these cans are only about 2/3 the size of regular soda cans, it's relatively filling and a single can makes for a decent drink. Sure, it has a fair amount of sugar, but it's not a diet product. And for most people, it's better to drink the natural sugar in fruit juice than the chemicals in most sodas.<br /><br />There are two problems: the price and the flavors. At nearly a dollar a can, even when purchased by the case, this is expensive stuff. One could simply buy some juice and some sparkling water and make a fair approximation without spending so much. The other issue is the fact that the recipe contains more apple and grape juice than kiwi or cherry juice. This isn't uncommon for juices made from expensive fruits, but in this case it's really noticeable.  However, it's less noticeable than it was in the Switch Black Cherry flavor -- the kiwi definitely stands out.  (If you're deciding between the two, go with Kiwi Berry.)  If you don't like apple or grape juice, that could be enough to ruin this drink for you."

I figured, well, I really enjoy Sumatra's bold, smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver, so why not?  Wolfgang puck has a few restaurants, so maybe he knows coffee.<br /><br />So, this is utterly average in all departments.  It's not very bold or rich, although I can say it does have the bitterness, which is a bit unbalanced as it lacks the richness.  Purchased only because it appeared on the Subscribe & Save at a great price per k-cup.  That makes two WP's that have been run of the mill at best [Sumatra & French roast].  Next time I'll be more discerning."

Arrived 2 days after it was expected & needed and the box was delivered & sat outside in 90 degree heat for several hours...not so great for chocolate coating!  I would have thought they'd package with a cool pack during the summer.?.  This tin size does hold a lot of toffee though!  Just wish the toffee had been more fresh tasting but I'm sure the heat didn't help the stale texture - like when you get an old Butterfinger bar.  Perhaps if it hadn't been summer & sat outside in the heat it may have been better.  Can only give it a 3 star rating because of the negatives."

You have to put milk and sugar in them to make them really delicious!  I like the Irish Breakfast - very full bodied.  The English breakfast is good but not my favorite when it comes to the Breakfast teas.  I like Republic of Tea's British Breakfast the best.  This is a great sampler package."

The email attempted to spread the blame between Amazon, its supplier and some mysterious unknown factor, ultimately taking no real responsibility for the blunder.<br /><br />Color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being, their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders.<br /><br />This to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the company's response was very wishy washy and lame. In my experience, when a company screws up (mind you it wasn't just my order, it was a whole slew of orders that got cancelled)<br />they should own up and take responsibility thereby showing some integrity, rather than mutter some indecipherable mumbo jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem."
216,B000CMIYWM,A1KXONFPU2XQ5K,Stephanie Manley,1226880000,A complex flavor that seems to offer relaxation,"Yogi Tea's offer high quality tea that taste wonderful.  They offer more complex flavors than traditional grocery store brands, and by purchasing them online, you get excellent prices.  My favorite teas of theirs are Calming and Bedtime.  Both seem to offer wonderful side effects of the feelings of relaxation.<br /><br />If you are not a big tea drinker these are still worth a try.  The flavors are complex and unique.  They are not a single note tea.  I have found these teas to never be bitter, and they are quite good without adding extras to make them taste better.<br /><br />I also like the lovely packaging, and the fortunes included on each tea bag.  I have found their blends to be unique and while I generally prefer bulk tea, that these are my favorite bagged teas.  If you looking for a tea that will help take the load off, give this one a try."
217,B003EML8PM,A34NVQTFD4QYJ0,Steve,1300147200,"good, not great",I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy. Just salty.

It tastes exactly like peanut butter. IT lives up to all the reviews.  If they have it in a bigger size I will be ordering it or maybe in multiple jars. I mixed it and put in the Arctic Zero Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor and I swear I almost cried, it was so good.  It was like omg.

I am almost tempted to break off a small piece and try it myself (ALMOST, but not quite).<br /><br />I think I will stop buying the cheaper, unhealthier brand treats from now on and go with the Newman's Own Organics line.

234,B001E4Q5WI,AOINAOO0NQRGN,Rooster Eberle,1289952000,Top of the line so far as reduced fat peanut butters,"I started buying Skippy several years ago after reading a number of consumer reviews that gave it a top ranking. The one that stuck with me the most was a polling of 12 year-olds, who gave Skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its tastes and texture. In writing this review, I went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think. I'm taking the liberty of quoting from the CookingLightly website so far as its review of Creamy:<br /><br />""The roasted peanuts on the ingredient list are evident in the heady aroma and balanced flavor. Testers thought this sample was a touch oily, but spread the best...Makes the perfect peanut butter sandwich, but can turn into a savory dressing when mixed with soy, vinegar, and crushed red pepper to serve over sugar snap peas, broccoli, or a stir-fry. For a sweet version, mix with honey and mayonnaise and use as a fruit salad dressing. Mix with chile paste with garlic (sambal oelek) or sriracha for an easy sauce for roast meats.""<br /><br />This is my opinion, too, and while the above review was for the regular Creamy, it applies in my opinion to the reduced fat version just as well. I love this peanut butter. I know that Jif and Peter Pan are also often ranked highly, but Skippy is by far my preference.<br /><br />While I use it on sandwiches, I often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein. It is so good in this role that I gave it to a diabetic friend. She uses it in lieu of orange juice if she's starting to feel hypoglycemic. The peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect.<br /><br />I will note that some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of reduced fat peanut butter. They have two ASIC points:<br /><br />1. The process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us.<br /><br />2. To compensate for any loss of taste, manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy.<br /><br />My rating is based on taste and texture. I'm not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue."

Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind.  -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels.

240,B002979DP0,A2LXX47A0KMJVX,M. Erb,1244332800,Delicious alternative to soda,"My review is of the Strawberry-Melon flavor only. I did not try the other flavors in the variety pack as I puchased mine individually.<br /><br />I don't usually drink these types of beverages, nor do I drink much soda. I generally dislike overly sweet, artificial ingredient laden stuff. Quite by chance I tried a Strawberry Melon FUZE slenderize beverage and really liked it.<br /><br />What I liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar, although it does have sucralose as a sweetener (rather than aspartame). It was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced; I could clearly distinguish both flavors.  FUZE was really tasty, no strong aftertaste and no sugar ""heaviness"" in the mouth. It was honestly the first time I've had this type of beverage other than a Snapple Tea beverage that I would purchase again.<br /><br />I'm a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro-nutrients that are added to this beverage; L-Carnitine, Super Citrimax and Chromium. Perhaps it's a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial. Nonetheless, I found this beverage to be refreshing, tasty and something I would buy again.<br /><br />It is a little bit pricey though. Compared to a 12-pack of store brand Diet Soda, which in my neck of the woods ia around $2.99 or a little over $.02/ounce, FUZE beverage is priced $24.99 for 15-18.5 ounce bottles, or a little over $.09/ounce. That makes it more than 4 times as expensive as the store brand diet sodas.<br /><br />In spite of the price, I would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute.<br /><br />5 stars."

297,B00390T5JA,A2TJG4N8LNJW23,Blythe Dresser,1326672000,We really couldn't be happier and now our Cusinart is in retirement...,"My boyfriend and I received the Keurig Elite brewer as a Christmas gift after lusting after the brewers all of my friends and family owned.  We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10-cup drip brewer for a couple of years now, and while it has served us well, it was a challenge to get a consistent cup of coffee.  Somehow we always ended up on either the too-strong or two-weak side of the line, despite our best efforts to be consistent.<br /><br />I should mention that we are students living on a very strict budget and we knew that the Keurig would end up being a little bit more costly than our Cuisinart.  But we really liked the idea of brewing coffee a cup at a time and cutting down on waste.  Thankfully, my generous sister surprised us with one for Christmas and it has really turned out to be a perfect gift!<br /><br />WARNING!<br /><br />I feel it is important to mention that we almost sent this back.  Considering how I've been singing its praises, I'm sure this is surprising, but there is something that ALL new Keurig owners should be made aware of.  The first maybe six or so cups aren't going to taste quite right.  Apparently this is a common problem.  There is a sort of plastic-y taste going on, even with coffees that don't normally have that fake finish.  It's the newness of the brewer.  Run five cups of straight water through it and then one cup of white vinegar to get rid of this problem.  I can't imagine how many people must have received one of these and then written it off immediately because of this issue.  It's a quick fix and a one-time deal, so be aware of that ahead of time.<br /><br />Now... as I was saying:<br /><br />The Keurig Elite is the entry level of the full size brewers (Keurig also makes a Mini, but we have friends who have had problems with that model).  It has a great water carafe that only needs to be refilled once every six cups (convenient!).  There is no digital display unlike some of the higher end models, but we don't find that a problem.  For those wanting to set up brew times in advance, though, that might be a make-or-break feature.  We manage just fine without it in our household.  It has the two cup sizes and, although they are only two ounces apart in size, the difference between the two can be quite dramatic.  I like a milder cup of coffee while my boyfriend prefers something stronger so I brew on the larger size while he picks the more potent smaller for his cup.<br /><br />When we turn the power on in the morning it takes about 3 minutes for the brewer to heat up and then it really truly does brew the cup in less than a minute.  SO convenient when you want to make a quick cup on your way out the door!  No muss, no fuss.<br /><br />We tried out several pods from the 12 k-cup sample pack the brewer came with (another bonus!) and since then we've also tried out a few of Keurig's other offerings.  It's really hit-and-miss in terms of what you'll like and what will be positively NOT your cup of coffee.  Here are some of the blends we have tried and enjoyed:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G"">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> - Our standard go-to good cup of coffee.  Nothing fancy or amazing, but consistently good flavor.  You can't go wrong with this medium roast.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KLM"">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> - An alternative to the Caribou Blend that might be easier to find in most stores.  One of the few Green Mountain cups that I've tried and enjoyed.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE"">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> - The only hot chocolate k-cup we've tried and enjoyed so far.  It is artificially sweetened and you can tell that immediately, but it isn't weak or watery and definitely gets the job done.  Tip: shake the pod before you put it in the machine to loosen the powder.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the Keurig and its pod system, however, is that the pods are wasteful and non-recyclable.  Very disappointing.  Keurig is reportedly working on making a recyclable pod, but until that comes out I feel a bit guilty about going through the pods so quickly.  However, there is a solution to this problem!  We picked up the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW"">ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> to use with our brewer!  And it has been perfect!  I'm Canadian so every time I visit home I pick up a big drum of Tim Horton's coffee (the best cheap coffee money can buy) and I can still use it in this little reuseable k cup.  Some reviewers had said that the ekobrew doesn't work with all Keurig models but I can attest to the fact that it works perfectly with the Elite brewer.  Apparently it is leaps and bounds better than Keurig's own reuseable My K Cup pod.  It's definitely worth the $10!<br /><br />Honestly, you really can't go wrong with the Keurig Elite.  We love it as a one-cup brewer without all the bells and whistles and we can't wait to try out the new pods we're set to receive from the included buy 2 get 2 free promotion through Keurig's website."

I don't know why. If I wanted Pistachios I would've bought them. I had a craving for almonds and these just don't do the trick. They also contain a weird ingredient; CORN MALODEXTRIN. WHY?! They are ALMONDS! All you need is almonds and salt, maybe oil! So much for being ""All natural""."
314,B005K4Q1VI,A3OAYBV9IQV33C,Rob,1323648000,Not bad. Not bad at all.,"I have read some really funny reviews about this product.  Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.<br /><br />I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  I've dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.  I'll buy it again!"

I find it to be very thick and syrupy, which is probably due to the use of rice sugar and other wholesome organic ingredients. Perhaps younger children wouldn't mind this texture and they would be able to suck it down and reap the benefits of the fiber and nutrients without knowing any better. Overall I'm going to stick with the gummies, but I look forward to more products coming out from Froose as healthy alternatives to some really bad options in the supermarket."

I have been eating Michael Seasons puffs and curls for at least two years and can't help but notice how their production has shifted from full-flavored to light-flavored (after which I wrote the company) to mixed-flavored. It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed. Still, because they contain at least partially organic ingredients, and because they taste so well overall, there's no other brand that beats them so I keep ordering anyway."

It was similar to Sunkist pop but it tasted more like real juice.  I enjoyed the taste and if you have the extra money and want a healthier alternative, you might want to give it a try, but it is still 140 calories per can.  So it isn't exactly a diet drink.

It made me wonder whether Coffee Masters uses the same equipment to make both a chocolate raspberry flavor and the dark chocolate decadence flavor, and if the flavors got mixed during the manufacturing process.<br /><br />Since then, I have ordered it several more times and have been more satisfied with it. There are times, however, when those burned flavor notes creep back in, depending on the bag. I sometimes wonder if Coffee Masters overroasts their beans.<br /><br />I originally bought this coffee instead of the chocolate coffee I used to regularly enjoy but could not find on Amazon, Brothers Gourmet Coffee Chocolate Swirl.  The Coffee Masters Dark Chocolate Decadence bean is darker, oilier, and richer than the Brothers bean.  The Brothers bean coffee is milder, more like Swiss chocolate.<br /><br />I still might prefer the medium-bean Brothers Blend over this coffee, even though it is a medium bean and not a dark bean, as the flavor profile tastes more like real chocolate.<br /><br />UPDATE: I am now actively seeking out coffees that are fair trade or direct trade or advertise ethical practices. Those that ignore the plight of the farmer and show no transparency in the process of the coffee from field to table I do not buy any longer. So this brand is no longer one that I will purchase.

I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.

These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting."

Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE"">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!"

Most food products, especially candy, is a rip-off from most Amazon sellers. However, the cereal is usually cheap. I think the 11.5oz was about $2.60 at Wal-Mart, but I paid  only $6.86 for the 1 package of 3 boxes here on Amazon, so that is about $2.29 for each box. That was a good deal, but now the page says $15 for 3 boxes, which is $5 a box. That is a rip for the 11.5oz box; you can get a 16oz box for only about $3.00 at Wal-Mart. So you have to watch the prices to see if it's cheaper or not.<br /><br />I was worried about the cereal not being fresh, but it is. My Lucky Charms were the new ones with the new marshmallows in them; currently it's the different colors of shooting stars. My boxes from Amazon have the same expiration date as the Frosted Flakes I bought at Wal-Mart, so that's a good thing.

The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.

We have been using it for more than ten years.  It goes great on all sorts of things -- chicken, beef, pork, fish, eggs (hard boiled, scrambled, or fried), baked potato, etc.  Not only is it a very good combination of spices, it is also ground fine and mixed well.  Whenever we fry something in batter or breading, Luzianne's Cajun Seasoning usually finds its way into the mix.<br /><br />We've tried ""Slap Ya Momma"" and other cajun spices, but those tend to be too coarse.  Instead of tasting a blend of spices, you tend to bite down on a nugget of salt, filling your mouth with the taste of salt, then a nugget of pepper, filling your mouth with the taste of pepper, etc.  Luzianne's is definitely the superior implementation.<br /><br />We recently ran out of it, and to our dismay Safeway has stopped carrying this product, which is why we have tried other brands.  None have measured up, which is why I was searching for it online.  We're very happy to have found it again on Amazon."

I am sorry the other reviewer seems to have had such a bad experience but I can honestly say that mine were not salty. And the can indicates that no salt has been added.

In my eagerness to buy this plant, I accidentally sent this plant to my home address instead of my dorm. Despite this delay, my plant arrived about one week after I first ordered it. (Had it been shipped correctly, it would have taken only four days). In addition, the plant STILL arrived in good condition. Its growing very well.<br /><br />A few things to note: This plant is, as stated, in a 3"" pot. Don't expect a giant man-eating plant. My plant came with about seven heads and a flower stem, which will hopefully bloom soon. The one thing that this plant does not come with his any sort of terrarium or other habitat for it, though the plant's robustness makes up for it. Make sure to follow the special care instructions with it and the plant will grow fine. It is definitely worth the cost and it makes  a perfect pet plant."

The hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size.  If you want a large cup of hot chocolate, use 2 k-cups.  It is fairly low in calories, most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little k-cup."

For bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch, and it's difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. It works great for asparagus, but only for small-ish bunches and if the spears aren't too tall.<br /><br />More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1/2"" of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. These pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag-topped-jar, however, and the clear front makes it harder to forget what's in there.<br /><br />They are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over. And the little drain port is fun to use.<br /><br />But it only works for small bunches."

Lastly, the dogs REALLY like/crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  When I'm doing repetitive action training over & over again (like teaching my one dog how to shake), I'd rather give him 10 of these than 10 pieces of hot dog or chemical-laden mushy dog snacks.

Heck, I'll drink whatever dreck the greasy spoons are serving without complaining. At home, I'll even reheat a cup that's been sitting around all day, as horrid as that sounds. I totally eschew that dark, burnt-tasting, supposedly gourmet Starbucks (jokingly called Charbucks in our home) simply because it's far too strong for my tastes. But when it comes to my fresh cup of coffee in the morning - you know, the one that gets you going, the most important cup of coffee you'll drink all day - I like it to taste robust, hearty, sensual and strong.<br /><br />Coffee made in drip coffee makers always seems to lack this quality. Coffee from those popular machines always has a somewhat ""cardboardy"" flavor, in my opinion. So it was with some trepidation that I chose to receive Melitta's Cafe Collection Classique. When I actually do make drip coffee or perked coffee (for dinner guests and the like), I grind the beans fresh which helps both styles have that coffee shop flavor you can't seem to get any other way, unless you own an espresso machine or a french press, but I digress.<br /><br />Since this is already ground in the bag, I knew that my best bet would be to make it over-strong to help the situation out. I don't own a french press, an espresso maker or any other fancy coffee gadgetry. Instead, I made a single, large mug with 4 tablespoons of coffee grounds tucked in side a Melita coffee filter (stapled shut) and brewed for about 6 minutes on high in the microwave, much the same way I make coffee from Folger's coffee singles.  And it worked, the coffee smelled great, was a nice dark color and I looked forward to my first warm sip.<br /><br />And that's when I became disappointed. As dark as the color was, as rich as the aroma was, the flavor was...  lackluster. It simply didn't stand up to my cheap, easy Folgers singles. And that's a shame, because now I have almost an entire container of coffee to go through. And about that container...  It was almost impossible to open. The gold wire wrap that is supposed to keep the coffee closed later fell off immediately. It took a pair of scissors to open the bag and even then there was some trouble. Compared to simply tearing open a Folger's single, this put one more hassle in my morning that I didn't need.<br /><br />All in all, it was just OK coffee. For a premium roasted coffee brand, you'd think this would knock me out of my slippers but instead left me pining for something else. Coffee, anyone?"

Also keep in mind that Chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products. All the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the United States.

Let's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy.  They never will.  We can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well-being. Make purchase decisions wisely.

The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the ""chicken flavor"" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended ""Golden Aloe"" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old."

This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them."

We used this blend to experiment with our new single-serve coffee maker, the Jura Ena Micro 1.  This is basically an espresso maker, but it can make several strengths, and besides espresso shots, it makes ristretto and lungo cups also. We found the Major Dickason's Blend to taste rich and full-flavored made as an intense shot and also as a milder 12 oz. regular cup of coffee. Can't get much better than that!  For a coffee to provide a great brew at many different strengths is a real plus.<br /><br />Be aware that this coffee is offered in both 12 and 16 ounce bags--and the bags look alike, so do your math before asssuming one bag is cheaper than another.

One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of ""calms"" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not ""crispy"" cookies, or the blurb would say ""crispy,"" rather than ""chewy.""  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.

Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical."

Otherwise they may find they go through a can a week, at best.<br /><br />Alone, this tea brews to an orangeish hue, no darker, and always tastes slightly understeeped, or overmilked.  I tried to oversteep, but no dice: It's as if the tea's been neutered, the merest hint of tannin erased. It's unnerving.<br /><br />If you want a tea that will pretty much always present pretty well, and are willing to pay extra for that pritnear peace of mind, Rishi's Earl Grey is a good bet.

We have had it with our cheese sandwiches, alongside pork roast and roast/grilled chicken.  It is one of those great sweet-tangy flavors with lots of vegetable pieces.

I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific.<br />I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled.<br />Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste.

She really loves the smell of them and totally wants to eat them...as soon as she sees me reach for the bag she gives me her full attention and comes up and waits eagerly. However, these things are 1""+ on each side and she can't fit them in her mouth. They come connected to other pieces, so first you have to break these apart from each other. Then if you have a small dog, like an IG for instance, you'll have to break or cut or crumble them up from there. It would be easier if they weren't almost literally rock hard, which makes it really difficult if you're trying to just break them up by hand (which means if you're taking some out with you you'll probably want to prepare them beforehand). But she does want to eat them and when I managed to get a small enough piece for her she ate it up; a slightly larger one she worked on and worked on trying to chew on it.<br /><br />These are USDA organic treats and they must be doing something right, because as I said our IG gets totally excited when she sees the bag being picked up.

Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its ""food"". and the company who makes it basically said ""Sorry, but it sucks to be you"".

Right off the bat let me say that just like their Sumatran reserve, this k-cup is not bitter, but smooth. The aftertaste is also smooth. My chief complaint is it does not taste like a Colombian bean. It really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee, while the Sumatran Puck K-cup definitely has a Sumatran taste. The ""8 oclock"" brand you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k-cup. That being said, my final recommendation is that I would recoommend the Puck Sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor. However, if you are looking for a not-too-stong-but-not-bitter coffee, this Colombian is a great choice. I would buy this again just because of the smooth taste."

That is when I discovered that he ""loves"" pancakes. I was aware that he liked waffles. (We've only been together almost five years!)  I, on the other hand, have never cared for pancakes.  I loved my Gram's waffles, but nothing she did could tempt me to eat pancakes, no amount of butter or slathering with strawberry jam could make a difference. I just didn't care for PANCAKES!  She did insist on teaching me how to make and cook them, because my Daddy enjoyed pancakes, so I learned.<br />I was in Central Market on Saturday when I ran into a co-worker and her husband.  They took me by the hand from the Baking Products isle to the Jams, Jelly, Syrup, Honey isle.  On the top shelf was ""the very best pancake mix"":  Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix. I saw the price and took a deep breath, it was twice the price of the mix I had just been contemplating purchasing. On their recommendation, I tossed it in the cart along with some ""real"" organic, light amber, maple syrup.<br />This morning, I fixed three small (3 inch diameter) pancakes for my man and one for myself just to taste. I needed to know!<br />Well, I don't believe I have ever had real maple syrup before in my life, just that sugar processed krapola sold as pancake syrup. I have NEVER liked that stuff!<br />That pancake with a tiny dribble of real maple syrup was DELICIOUS! It was the pancake mix that made the difference.<br />Now I am reading reviews to purchase a waffle maker.  After tasting that light, fluffy pancake, I can hardly wait to have some waffles made from this mix.  These reviews are making my mouth water with anticipation!<br />I will never buy any thing else."

796,B008ZRKZSM,A1Y82GMMVWQHIZ,Jersey Coffee Girl,1273622400,Really Good,"This product is very good. I follow the directions exactly and mix it with water.. I havent tried mixing it w/ jelly or honey or anything else, as some others have suggested; the whole reason I bought this was because I wanted a lower calorie, lower fat alternative to regular peanut butter, so for me, mixing it with 150 calories worth of jelly doesnt make any sense.<br /><br />In any case, this is definitely NOT exactly like regular peanut butter.. the consistency is a little different, but I suppose you could adjust that to your own liking by adding more or less water. Also, you can definitely tell that this is a lower fat product than regular peanut butter; I mean, when you take a tablespoon of regular peanut butter, you can instantly taste and sense the richness due to the fat content, and when you eat PB2, you definitely notice the difference. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, just different. Its almost the same as if you are used to eating super premium, high fat ice cream, and then one day you switch to low fat; the low fat may still taste very good, but because you are so used to eating the high fat stuff, you will instantly notice a difference-- however, once you get used to it, it wont bother you.<br /><br />I would say PB2 is the same... its definitely NOT the exact same taste / texture as regular peanut butter, but its still very good. it has a very fresh, ""clean"" taste. in my opinion, its DEFINITELY worth the compromise, considering the huge amount of fat and calories in regular peanut butter, and how much healthier PB2 is in comparison . I have cravings for peanut butter just about every day, but up to now, I have only allowed myself to eat regular peanut butter about once a week, due to the fat and calorie content...  but now, since finding PB2, I allow myself to have it whenever I want it.<br /><br />By the way.. I tried the PB2 Chocolate version-- I ordered a sample from their website-- it was OK.. not fabulous, not bad. to me, if I am going to really ""go for it"" and eat chocolate peanut butter anything, its not going to be a low fat version, because its just not worth it. in other words, if I had a craving for a Reeses peanut butter cup, chocolate PB2 would not satisfy that craving. On the other hand, when I have craving for regular peanut butter-- in a sandwich or right off of a spoon, regular PB2 will satisfy that craving without wrecking my diet. Bottom line: if you arent sure whether or not you will like this product, go to the Bell Plantation website and spend the four bucks and order a sample, and give it a try, then you will know for sure before you commit to buying 4 jars plus shipping. ( and folks, the shipping costs almost as much as the 4 jars, so make sure you like this before you order it! )<br /><br />My final verdict is I am pretty sure I will be replacing regular peanut butter with PB2 for as long as they keep making it, and will probably order it by the case in the future to save on shipping."

Unsure if her reactions were due to environment or food, but they didn't seem to be seasonal grass allergies, so I chose to test the easiest source first.  I chose a food with a completely different meat source, switching from chicken to fish.  It's only been a week and I'm already seeing improvement.  She's still showing signs of itchiness, but her reaction is much less when I pet her back.  And on top of that, her fur is softer too!  It's early yet, and there can still be some progress made, but I have no doubt that the change in food is helping.  I sat and read review after review on dog foods with in-depth ingredient analysis before settling on Pinnacle Trout & Sweet Potato.  If after 6 weeks, she still shows some signs of being itchy, I'll happily try the Salmon and Potato Grain Free variety to see if grains are a factor in her allergies as well.<br /><br />Have seen some reviews mentioning breath after eating the fish based foods.  I have to say, I haven't experienced this with my dogs.  There might be a slightly different odor to their breath, but it isn't by any means too ""fishy"" smelling.  Just different.

No matter how convenient or easy, no matter the choices of coffee, forget everything else- there is a huge problem with the way they made the maker itself.  The hinged clam-shell of the K-cup holder uses an amazingly poorly designed plastic track.  This track is formed in a complex set of curves that the mated piece must follow.  The pieces are simply bare, dry, plastic.  Over time they start to drag and catch as they try to follow this complex curve as you open and close the clam-shell.  When the inevitable dragging and catching starts, the K-cups suffer a jagged puncture from the upper piercing water fill piece.  This is catastrophic because anything less than a perfect small hole allows coffee grounds to flood out the top of the K-cup during the brew.<br />Once this happens, you will never know if the next brew will work normally or you'll get coffee grounds everywhere.<br />Just Google Keurig hole problem.

I was skeptical from all the talk of ""fishy smell and taste"". Thus being the reason i ordered the single pack. I prepared them as instructed and prepared them into a soup. I used chicken breasts cut into strips, boiled them into a broth with sliced carrots, green onions, and broccoli, and then poured it into the bowl over the noodles. Me and my girlfriend tried it and it turned out great. She put some soy sauce in hers because she liked it better that way, but we both loved it. It did not have the fish smell after rinsing, nor while eating it. The texture is comparable to the rice noodles you find in Vietnamese and Japanese dishes. I am a convert to miracle noodle. I fed two people off of one pack, not bad i say. Also noticed the difference in the curving of my snack urges(didn't even touch my yogurt, orange, or nature valley peanut butter bar until near the end of my shift at work), and could wait longer before i took my lunch at work. I work 10 hour night shifts, so that's why i ate this before work. These are a great tool into any nutrition plan in my book."

However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.<br /><br />The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.<br /><br />I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb."

I am asking Amazon for a refund - otherwise, they are going in the trash unused.<br /><br />Copied from FDA web site.<br /><br />FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products<br />November 18, 2011<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]"

I have an almost 2 year old chocalate lab.  When i got him from the breeder at 9 weeks he was on Eukanuba, which he stayed on with me at 1st.  After talking to a friend who breeds world class vizlas, she told me how she feeds them Canidae and how wonderful it is.  I switched over to Canidae then thank god and ever since.  My chocalate lab people actually think is a black lab.  He is the darkest chocolate lab u have ever seen, his coat is so beautiful and glossy, when he was on the eukanuba it was light brown and discolored.  Coats can be a huge problem with choc labs, but canidae has solved that problem.  With all the problems with menu foods that include so called good foods like eukanuba, science diet, iams, etc, it is a relief i can trust canidae and not be worried about all that.

The only problem that I have is the size of the can. At 8.3 ounces it may be enough for a kid, but you would need more than one of these to quench an adult's thirst."

I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!<br /><br />Not a good buy IMO.

Mind you, it would take two of these to fill me like a clif bar does.<br /><br />It's about 2/3rd's the size of a clif bar, it's loaded with oats (this is the first thing you taste) and chocolate chips (which is about the last thing you taste). They are moist and chewy like a soft cookie. About a medium sweetness compared to a regular cookie.<br /><br />Per bar: calories (180), fat (9 gr), carbs (23 gr), fiber (2 gr), and protein (2 gr).<br /><br />Ingredients: GF oats, organic agave, brown rice flour, white rice flour, sweet rice flour, tapioca starch, xanthan gum, organic chocolate chunks (organic natural evaporated can sugar, organic cocoa paste, organic cocoa butter, non-GMO soy lecithin/emulsifier, gluten-free organic vanilla) coconut sugar, monounsaturated safflower oil, organic eggs, almonds, coconut, chia seeds, natural flavors, sea salt, baking soda, xanthan gum.<br /><br />They do note on the packaging that there may be traces of milk, nuts, peanuts or soy because of what they're processed on.<br /><br />Overall, they're pretty darn good.  I do taste a bit of baking soda (but I think that's me, I'm pretty sensitive to it) at the end of a bite, but the oats really are the main taste.<br /><br />As someone who eats gluten free would I eat these if I was out and about and had to take a break quickly?<br /><br />Yeah, I would.<br /><br />They're like a soft, oaty cookie, easy to take, good ingredients, and they do taste quite nice.

I'll review them together because there isn't that much to write about.<br /><br />First, I'll admit a little bias.  I'm not a fan of sugar-based drinks.  I drink diet pop, Crystal Light drinks, and I use saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose.  I find sugar-based drinks generally ""gummy"", although carbonated drinks are somewhat preferable to non-carbonated drinks.  While there is ""no sugar added"" to these drinks, the fruit juice itself is quite full of sugar.<br /><br />The Switch brand drinks are lightly carbonated, which helps them in my opinion - others may disagree.  The gumminess is still there, though.  The fruit flavor is not strong enough to overcome this and I found that I needed this drink to be extremely cold (as in near frozen) to enjoy it.  I did not like the aluminum can for this product either.  I find that fruit-flavored drinks seem to latch onto the aluminum flavor more than other drinks.<br /><br />My personal preference was for the Black Cherry, but others may like the Kiwi Berry.

They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%"

953,B000Z978SS,A1SO1PGDNVMLXC,kalyson,1218326400,Great stuff!,"If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best.  It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol.  But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects.  If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar.  If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste.  Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste.  If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste.  This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar.  You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia.  It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter.  You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it, in spite of their ""100% satisfaction guarantee"". I am sticking with Now Foods from now on.<br /><br />Also:  It is a bit misleading that they call this particular item ""powdered"".  Regular powdered sugar is pulverized and has cornstarch added to give it that silky feel, as well as calcium phosphate to improve its flowing ability.  What they mean here, though, is that it is a much finer grain than their regular erythritol.  It is still a grain, however.  I buy it because it dissolves faster than the larger crystals, but both are good products."

I will say that most recipes I could find must have been for some cheap tea bags (weak, somewhat tasteless and bitter), so I experimented a little and found a great recipe for this loose leaf tea.  The recipe is 1/4 cup tea to 8 cups water.  Bring the water to a boil take it off the heat, put the tea in, let it steep for NO MORE THAN 5 minutes and strain into a container, let cool to room temperature and refrigerate.  If you are in a hurry, fill a glass with ice and pour the tea over the ice.  This works great for this particular loose leaf tea - not strong, not weak.

989,B002DFYOGG,AMP9LWIL026LW,rocketman,1350259200,Super-Dooper,"A quick recommendation, get the .5 ounce bottle, or smaller. And if you keep one in your pocket or purse or bag, make sure you swap it with the one on your counter that you use for the morning coffee. What happens is that the liquid dries up and begins to clog the opening. Not right away, but after several months of being opened. And once it's clogged up the single drop either gets smaller or larger. The issue is that you want one perfect drop! No more, no less. One drop is VERY powerful. If you get half a drop, don't try adding more. Open a packet of Splenda and add a tiny bit. You can easily get coffee so sweet you'll have to throw it out.<br /><br />There are a lot of reviews on this product criticizing it for drying up and problems such as I've just mentioned. Consequently, the smaller the bottle the better.

No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  ""It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,"" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.<br /><br />There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?<br /><br />But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?

It is great, and with recent changes in Twinings lineup, I'm sure more people like me are out there looking for a good replacement-- so I hope this will be helpful to some who are doing as I have done. I took a blind chance on this tea-- and I am so glad I did. I've been a fan of black currant iced tea ever since I first tried it. For years I used Twinings brand, but they have changed their formula and I have read many negative reviews, so I decided to look for a new brand. I tried several others and Mighty Leaf black currant has been the best so far.  If you are a fan of Twinings Black currant (the original) and/or you like the black currant iced teas served by Jason's Deli or Corner Bakery, you will probably really like this tea as it has a very similar taste. It is slightly stronger and has a little more of a ""bite"" than Twinings version did, (which I like)  and it is an excellent quality tea all around. There are several brands out there whose interpretation of what black currant tea tastes like is very far removed from this flavor I am familiar with. A few of them I tried were just downright weird. I am not really sure which black currant taste is more ""authentic"" to be honest, I just know what I like and I am very very happy with this tea. I will be buying this brand from now on for making my iced tea. It is well worth having to order it."

I've read people reviews and they said there were small brown pieces that were hard, that means they were not cooked long enough.  The best way to cook these are to use a medium size pan, pour the pack into the pan and shake it around and bake them in the oven @ 400 degrees for 4-6 minutes, keep a close eye on them because they burn easy.  But it is worth it to cook it in the oven, very hot and fresh and no uncooked curls.  They will appear to be brown at first but they ""poof"" up in the oven once they're heated.  I would say do not microwave these in a bag, use a oven safe plate, that way you can actually see them puff up, older/cheap microwaves can take 4-6 minutes to cook."

Though this is something that can be reused by melting, not for the seeding for which I'd needed this. They were not agreeing for return for a product that reached me in a form that was not acceptable. I had to explain my need and purpose. They did not refund my previous shipment or tax nor did they pay for the return shipment. I ended up paying $25 for the return shipment. The product is a lot costly through this vendor. Actually double its price. I bought a 5kg block of the same chocolate from a local Callebaut vendor. Please research your local listings. Stop buying through these channels. If you want Callebaut chocolates, call the number in the callebaut website and get the contacts of the local distributor. While through this vendor the milk/white chocolate for 1kg costed me close to $50 with shipping, I bought the 5kg block from the local distributor for just $47!!"

I usually just get the cheapest coffee I can find near my office; after all, I don't make a lot of money and every penny counts. So it was nice to get this Melitta Cafe ground coffee to sample.<br /><br />When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe it's because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50-cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days I've grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonald's (when they give out free cups).<br /><br />For a pack of 3, the price seems decent. If you drink decaf, I think this is quite worth a try."
1053,B007HP9T5S,AS9UB97EO5PD7,Meghan Donovan,1347235200,Great for anyone who loves matcha and fresh mangoes!,"The smell of this tea is wonderful. It smells like fresh mango juice. I would describe it as a very clean and refreshing smell, which is how I feel about most matchas. I will also say that I had no issues with clumps. I have been very careful to check the temperature of my water before adding it to the tea, and so far have not had any bitter disasters. The mango matcha has a grassy sweetness that definitely keeps the mango taste. The actual flavour isn't as strong as the smell, but I think that it would be overpowering if it was. I love this both hot and iced, which a slight edge going to the iced version. I haven't tried it yet in a smoothie, but I am thinking it would be fantastic. I did try adding a bit to some yogurt, and it was almost perfect - this was the only time I had clumps, but I also wasn't very patient trying to mix it all together. I would definitely purchase this again, and can't wait to try more from Red Leaf Teas."
1054,B000084ETV,A3DAXM59DANA8Z,Gemma Zanowski,1170028800,The best product for the price,"After reading the book ""Deadly Feasts"" I was horrified to learn what kinds of items may end up in my dogs' food! I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova, Canidae, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul...etc. I initially settled on Canidae, but also tried Wellness on a recommendation. The Wellness produced loose stools in two of my foster poodles, so I no longer use that brand. The Canidae, however, is perfect for my multi dog household, which often includes dogs ranging from puppyhood to senior status. The ingredients are phenomenal and, as all reviewers have said, the food contains no corn, wheat or soy, all common allergens in dogs. Although I also use and would recommend Innova Evo dry dog food, Canidae costs $35 for 40 pounds and Innova costs about $50 for a 28 pound bag. So, if you are budgeting a bit but would still like to give your dog the best, Canidae is great. After switching my dogs to Canidae, I noticed several things. First, my labrador retriever's coat sheen increased to the point of nearly blinding me in the sunglight; second, he lost about 10 pounds and developed greater muscle tone (although he was always fed recommended portions of commercial foods); third, my shedding dogs shed a lot less than in the past; and fourth, bad doggy breath is greatly reduced. I see no excuse not to switch your dog from a commercial food to Canidae or another super premium brand - it costs no more than a fancy bag of Iams or Science Diet, but can add quality years to your pets' lives! If you own a dog prone to allergies, such as a poodle, this food can't be beat. I had a family adopt a 5-pound malipoo from me and they emailed me to say they cannot feed him anything other than Canidae or he develops loose stools and needs to be taken out to the bathroom contantly. For your dog's sake switch their food; you can do a lot better than chain-store foods!"

Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!"

I love the convenience of the machine, but it was like grabbing a cup at the convenience store taste-wise - just the required morning medication, eh.<br /><br />So I was really, really surprised and delighted when I discovered this one.

It was actually more highly carbonated than I was expecting, but didn't taste dry the way I would expect an artificial-sugar-free drink to taste with carbonation added.  I was hoping it would taste more ""orangey,"" but the tangerine is the more dominant flavor (along with apple, a common juice ""filler"").  Despite having ""no added sugar,"" however, there is still 34 grams worth of it in the small 8.3oz can.  Basically, other than having 100% of the daily value of Vitamin C, this drink could easily be replaced with a better tasting orange soda that is in a 12oz can and costs far less.

I associate that name with safe for people trying to avoid sugar, even though I have been challenged several times, perhaps by people that are trouble makers at best but obviously more informed on the subject than I will ever be.  Yes, they have their little taste for they are very tiny for all the unwrapping it requires to consume them and who knows which fruit is which, in the end they all seem to taste the same. Not like eating a mint mentos where the moment it goes in your mouth you know exactly what you are getting. Still, they serves its purpose, for the person that I bought these morsels consumes them without truce, and that makes me content, for I am trying in my limited ways to keep this person from consuming large quantities of sugar, if I can help it, which is not all the time.

I made a fine grind of the beans, and brewed it in a press. Sad to say, it was the most disappointing cup of coffee I have had in a long time.

I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results."

However, since we've come back home he's pooped in my apt 3 times! (in 1 week) He NEVER does that. I thought that maybe he was being spiteful, but I really think he just can't help it. The food is one hell of a laxative if thats what you're looking for. I'm glad I only bought the small bag because I WILL NOT be giving this one another try.

1168,B004EKO2HE,A1RQQ2HWUGEUWA,EB MamaBear,1323820800,"NOT what I originally ordered! BOO, amazon!","As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!

Still, drinking it is very much like drinking a soda, but you get your Vitamin C. I found the balance of sweetness and carbonation to be good, although just a little more carbonation would give this an added zip.<br /><br />What I especially like about this product is that it is all natural and there is no high-fructose corn syrup in the drink. However, this is not a low-calorie beverage, and the 8.3 ounce can had more than 100 calories. If you are going to include this product in your diet, be aware of that. It is fruit juice -- and yes, it has the calories. But this is a food and not just empty soda calories.<br /><br />I gave this flavor 4 stars because I found the kiwi flavor somewhat lacking. It's not bad, I just think the apple juice was more noticeable, although the strawberry flavor came through nicely. A stronger kiwi-strawberry flavor would have gotten 5 stars.<br /><br />As for the can, I found the zip tab a little difficult to open because of the proximity of the ring to the edge of the can. But I'm a bit of a klutz; I have problems with potato chip bags. So take this caveat with a grain of salt. I think the manufacturer has found a good size for the cans, because you get just enough of the drink to feel like you've had a treat, but not so much that the calorie count is on overkill."

I thought it would make an elegant, classical gift; the picture looks all elegant, prettily-packed with a  bow.<br /><br />Well, the box I received looked nothing like the box in the picture. It came in a cheap-looking blue cardboard box with the same inside wrapping you'd find in a McDonald's toy. Worst of all, some of the candies had jack-o-lantern wrapping. That's fine in October, but by New Year's, it looks like old Halloween candy! I couldn't use it as a gift because I didn't want them to think I was giving them leftover Halloween candy.<br /><br />If you're ordering the box for yourself, by all means, go for it. The quality of the candies is just fine. But if you're ordering it to give as a gift, watch out! I think they just ship you the oldest (sometimes out-of-season) box they have.

However, I'm very aware that this is a problem for many people, some of whom are unaware that they have a problem but know they're not functioning as they should. I do know what it's like to be unable to digest food that you like (in my case, any sort of meat) and wheat is even more difficult to avoid, so I can sympathize.<br /><br />Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars are meant to provide a tasty, healthful snack for the gluten-intolerant. They're sweetened with agave and the ingredients are palatable to both celiac sufferers and those who just want a snack that's devoid of white sugar. These bars are guaranteed gluten-free, come individually wrapped, and are packed five to the box.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are actually pretty tasty--their lack of ingredients like stevia ensures that they have a pleasant sweetness that's gentle and tastes completely natural. And the other flavors are well-balanced as well--there are plenty of chocolate chips of good quality and the presence of coconut is a plus. But the fact of the matter is that Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars suffer from a fault that's pretty consistent in individually wrapped desserts of this kind: they're just too damp and lacking in crispness. Yes, I know that we all want chewy cookies nowadays and that cookie dough is held to be a gastronomic pinnacle to some. But I prefer my ""soft"" tempered by some external ""snap,"" so this isn't the ideal snack for me. It tastes nice but the texture, for me, falls short (your own mileage may vary).<br /><br />Regardless of my personal quirks, the fact that the food industry is accommodating those with food sensitivities and doing their best to do so in such a way as to use quality ingredients is fantastic. For those who like a damp, moist cookie, these just might be your idea of heaven--gluten-intolerant or not. Not my first choice for a nosh but this, I reiterate, is a purely personal call."

Since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and I have a sweet tooth, I felt this was a safe alternative.

It tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package, for a fraction of the price. After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the ""astronaut"" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.<br /><br />Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.<br /><br />It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.<br /><br />With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream. So be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product."

Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream."

This means your steak is going to burn a bit unless you keep the heat on medium or lower. When I use this steak rub I tend to cook the steaks a little on each side and then I cut them up into smaller pieces and continue frying. This guarantees that they won't burn. To be honest I can't really taste the rosemary in this mix, the peppers are much more prominent. My husband loves to eat the steaks with a little Tiger Sauce. He thinks that makes them just perfect.

Simply comparing the nutrition facts with any regular peanut butter immediately shows you the extreme difference in fat.  I know, I know, fat from nuts is supposedly ""good fat,"" but you still don't want too much of any type of fat in your diet.  PB2 essentially gets rid of the fat you don't need.  As I understand it, the peanuts are crushed down and the oil is soaked out of them.  Then, the remaining powdered peanuts are packaged up with a ""seasoning"" of salt and sugar (the ONLY other 2 ingredients in it) and you have PB2!<br /><br />To reconstitute it, all you do is add 1 tablespoon of water to 2 tablespoons of the powdered PB2 and mix until you have peanut-butter-consistency.  It really does taste just like peanut butter.  Even my husband liked it, and he's not afraid to say something tastes nasty when it's trying to be healthy.  He loved the taste and was even happier afterwards when I showed him the back of the bottle compared to our regular peanut butter bottle.  This is especially great for any baking recipes that call for peanut butter b/c we all know how difficult it can be to make those cookies and other sweet things ""healthy."""

I typically brew the 9.25 oz size, and on these guys I bumped it down to the 7.25 oz size.

It's pretty obvious when you pull these tomatoes out of the can that they were picked at their ripest, due to their deep red color and soft texture. Many tomatoes advertise themselves as San Marzanos, but since SM is a type of tomato, they could have been grown anywhere. Not these. These are SM tomatoes grown in the San Marzano region of Italy, in volcanic soils perfect for growing tomatoes. I have no affiliation with Cento, I just love a perfect tomato sauce. Use these tomatoes, be sure to not cook the sauce for more than 15 minutes, and you'll see what I mean. Even using fresh, locally grown, in-season tomatoes I haven't been able to get the depth of flavor that I do with the Centos."

It's very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor. The texture of all of the ingredients is decent, neither too firm nor too mushy, except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too saucy.

This stuff is absolutely delicious, I seriously put it on everything. I keep a bottle in my office with me for my lunch everyday. I seriously can't get over how good this stuff is. It reminds me of a more tasty taco bell hot sauce initially, then the tangyness kicks in, next thing you know the burn of the spicy habanero is there.

If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean.

The only drawbacks I have found is that you really have to fill the filter all the way up to get good flavor. It leaks a little bit so the outside of the cup is a bit wet after using. Lastly, water moves through it a bit slower than normal K-cups so brewing a cup takes a bit longer than normal. I would still highly recommend this to anyone who wants to use their own coffee with their Keurig machine!"

Harissa is a pasty substance that is very hot - way hotter than Tabasco or other brands of hot sauce common in the US. Harissa contains seeds of chili peppers.

I was so happy to find something like this for my 7 year old!  Unfortunately, the cupcakes were really - icky.  They tasted like corn muffins.  My son is gluten free due to sensitivity, not a disease.  Therefore he does not have to be 100% gluten free.  This makes our choices a bit wider when I am looking at ingredients for him.  The chocolate chip cookies were very good and I'd buy the mix again and make them.  I bought both the chocolate and vanilla cupcake mix.  We found them heavy, and didn't really like the taste.  They were totally disappointing.  I can now go to Hannafords and buy pre made gluten free cupcakes that are actually yummy - they are also a bit heavy.  They don't taste like corn bread and that is the plus.  My suggestion if you order these is make them mini cupcakes and make or buy your own frosting.  For someone who is gluten free, they do taste better than lots of things you can buy and make.  For kids who aren't - they will notice a big difference and most likely not like or want them."
1445,B000B9SFP2,AZFHSPEZUPGD2,Carol M,1309651200,"Very good corral for 1 horse, maybe 2 with additional electric tape","I love portable electric corrals.  They are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping, etc.  They are easy to use, give your horse some walking around room,  don't require a level set-up area, are flexible for size/shape, and are  small enough to keep handy in your trailer's tack room.  I much prefer using these to portable panels, high-lining, tying to the trailer, etc.<br /><br />There are many portable corral kits on the market, all very similar with the same kinds of components.  (Except the Zareba EZEE, which is a different animal.)  So I'll give you a component-by-component rundown on the items in this kit.<br /><br />CHARGER - This kit comes with a charger that takes 2 D batteries.  I was leery of this, having had less-than-stellar performance from a 2D charger in the past.  But this one works pretty good, producing a reasonable strength zap with 100 feet of electric tape (with good grounding in damp, solid soil).  If your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing, this should be sufficient.  The charger is easy to use, with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked.  The on-off switch is very accessible, and a light and an audible sound tell you when it's on.<br /><br />ELECTRIC TAPE --  This kit is advertised as coming with 200 feet of ½"" tape.  My kit had only 100 feet.  100 feet is enough for one horse.  I don't know where they're coming with up the statement `perfect for containing 4-5 horses for short periods of time'.  No way, not even close, even if I had received the full 200 feet.  Of course, it's easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store.  But beware that the more tape you add on, the less zap you'll get from your charger.  So I'm not sure if the 2D charger would be strong enough with 200 feet of tape.  The tape in this kit comes with a handle pre-installed.  It's a nice handle with a good feel to it, but it doesn't connect nicely to the posts.  I rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the  handle to.<br /><br />STEP-IN POSTS - These are my favorite kind of step-in posts.  Each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through, so you can set at the right height.  It's very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips, making set-up and take-down easier.<br /><br />CORNER GUY LINES - This kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal bracing stakes.  Honestly, I'll probably never use them.  With this style of fence, there usually isn't much (if any) tension on the posts, so  I've needed corner guy lines.  Why add to set-up and take-down time?  But if you prefer to use the corner guy lines, I think you'll like the ones in this kit.  They are nice quality adjustable lines, with metal stakes.<br /><br />WIRES, GROUND ROD, ETC -- Of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence, and the charger to ground.  The ground rod is a 12"" pointed spike.  Nothing special here.<br /><br />CARRYING BAG - Oh my gosh, A+++ for this carrying bag!  The bag has one long skinny section for the posts, and a separate snap-off zipper tote for the other components.  Within the smaller bag, there  are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece.  No more jumble of stuff!!!  I love it.  (One quibble - one of the step-in posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping.  The bag is made of pretty heavy-duty fabric, but not quite heavy-duty enough to stand up to a pointed spike.  And the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problem.)<br /><br />All in all, this portable fence kit is about as good as any I've seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral.  Just don't expect it to ""contain 4-5 horses "", unless you're rotating those horses in and out one at a time."

1448,B0045XE32E,A2G9UDL72YUTT8,Book and Dog Lover,1299542400,My dogs loved them,"There's such a range with dog treats - you can find those fake bacon treats that are filled with chemicals and then you can find these treats that contain only organic ingredients - no strange chemicals that you can't pronounce. If you want to give your dog healthy organic treats that they'll like, these treats are it.<br /><br />These treats are about 2 inches by 1 inch, scored in the middle so that you can break them in half (even scored, it can be difficult to break them in half). These treats are very hard - so if you have a dog with dental problems (like a senior dog), they will have problems eating these treats. If you have a dog that leaves crumbs and doesn't vacuum the floor for every morsel, you'll find plenty of crumbs after your dog eats these treats.<br /><br />Taste-wise, my dogs loved these treats. I have 2 large dogs (Labs) who, granted, love all treats. I decided to try a taste test - since my dogs will eat their favorite treat first, I was curious to see how these treats fared with some of their other treats. I gave my dogs these treats, a lite doggie treat, and a bacon/cheddar treat (both of these treats are made by Old Mother Hubbard). Of the three times I tried this test, one Lab consistently preferred the Old Mother Hubbard (OMH) bacon/cheddar treat (and would eat this treat a quick second), the other Lab preferred the Newman's Own treats. Considering that the Lab who ate the OMH treats first, tried to eat these at almost the same time, I'll say he liked these treats a lot too.<br /><br />For the amount of treats and with Amazon's current price, I think this is great deal for a healthy doggie treat."

This vendor bully sticks are at MOST 1/2"" thick, with most closer to 1/4"".<br /><br />What difference does it make?<br /><br />Our dog, a slender 44 lb. mixed boxer/chow, would take 3-5 days to get through a 3/4"" bully stick, and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one.

Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.<br /><br />I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.<br /><br />That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.<br /><br />I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins)."

The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else.

As for a PB sandwich?  Not as sure.  I've mixed it with jelly, and it's pretty good, but I missed the texture contrast that you get with real PB.  I mitigate this by adding a very thin layer (I have a problem with putting WAY too much PB on) of real PB to my bread and then supplementing with the powdered stuff.  It works better that way, I think, and I don't get all the calories from using all regular PB.  I probably wouldn't buy this from amazon again because of the price, but I'm glad I tried it, and if it's on sale at whole foods or something I'd buy it.<br /><br />Oh, be careful when you're opening the jar for the first time...no sudden movements or you'll be covered in PB powder, and at this price, every grain is precious!"

I also have my own burr grinder, French press, espresso maker and 2 drip coffee makers (2 cup and 12 cup). So where does VIA fit into my coffee life? I typically use a VIA packet when I want a quick cup of coffee and don't want to take the time or effort to brew a pot (12 cup or 2 cup coffee makes).<br />Pros:<br />* Fast and convenient.<br />* Taste great for an instant coffee - it is not quite as good as fresh brewed but remarkably better than other instant coffee.<br />Cons:<br />* It is expensive. So watch the price on Amazon it will vary greatly over time. I tell my wife we are not ""Pay the full price people"". Put the item in your cart and then if u have time check your cart daily for a while. (I do this for all Amazon purchases since the price does really fluctuate for most items). For VIA I have found that watching it can save me 50% or more on Amazon - the price of this item locally never changes much.<br />* It is not the same as good brewed coffee. Don't expect this to be the same as fresh brewed coffee - all else constant (I.e. filtered water etc.)"

So to be fair, I waited until the following day before trying the Kiwi Berry flavor to allow the taste of the black cherry to be completely gone from my taste buds.<br />I actually found the Kiwi Berry taste to be much more pleasing than the Black Cherry flavor. The carbonation fizz was not as pronounced, disguising that cheap wine cooler flavor. I drank this Kiwi Berry down fairly quickly wanting to saturate my pallet to see if I would once again suffer that bad after-taste.<br />Sure enough, there it was. After careful thought trying to come up with an accurate description on paper of what these drinks taste like to me, what I realized was, if you were to take a glass and fill it half way with a cheap wine cooler and the other half with a warm can of beer that was left over from the previous nights party, you would create the exact same bad after taste I seem to get from drinking either the Black Cherry or Kiwi Berry flavor of the ""Switch"" carbonated fruit juice drinks.<br />Only because the Kiwi Berry flavor tasted great going down, I give this drink a 2 Star rating.

Saint ""Honest & Heartfelt""",1245196800,Buy the ORIGINAL BACONNAISE not the LITE flavored one!,"Hey Bacon Lovers,<br /><br /> The original BACONNAISE is absolutely delicious!  There is NOTHING else like it on store shelves!  No, I am not the maker of this product or associated with it in any way other than being a HAPPY CUSTOMER!  YUMMMY!<br /><br />  The LITE Baconnaise, just like most calorie restricted products, doesn't taste as great as the original, fattier Baconnaise!  I suggest you go to J&D's website & buy the original BACONNAISE and not the lite variety.<br /><br />  I was hooked on FAST FOOD, especially McDonald's Big Macs!  I got a jar of original Baconnaise (looks darker than the lite jar that is pictured here)  after seeing it featured on Oprah.  It was LOVE AT FIRST BITE!<br /><br /> Although it's NOT a diet food, I have lost almost 10 pounds in only 3 weeks because I'd rather eat at home using my Baconnaise than grab something at the drive-thru!  I especially like a lean Roast Beef sandwich with Baconnaise.<br /><br />No fast food means no french fries or super sized Coke, so I think that's why I'm dropping the pounds!  Financially, we're saving a lot of CASH $$$ because I have DISCOVERED something that makes me SATISFIED with what I'm putting in my mouth.  Does that make sense?  Seriously, it costs us about $20 a fast food meal & we used to eat out several times a week.  We still do pizza every so often, but fast food has lost its allure!<br /><br />  I even went so far as to dab on some Baconnaise on a stalk of (ugh) broccoli yesterday & it was EAT-ABLE for once!  I can assure you I am NOT a veggie eater AT ALL!  Thanks to this tasty product, I now have hope that I can break my ADDICTION to fast food.  Even eating some veggies is NOW a possibility (almost an unbelievable statement from a junque food junkie!)<br /><br />  I took the time to write this because I could NOT believe the negative reviews and wanted to CLARIFY for all of those thinking about trying Baconnaise to purchase the ORIGINAL Baconnaise formula.  It has HELPED ME a great deal & I am now hooked for life!<br /><br /> Good Luck & Happy Eats! :D"

For mornings, I like a stronger coffee to really kick off the day, but when it comes to an afternoon pick-me-up, I prefer a medium coffee and the Nescafe Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo fills that nicely. The instructions suggest you do a 4 oz. pull for a Lungo or a 6 oz. pull for an Americano.

Like the espresso for the same machine, this blend has nutty hints in the coffee. Overall, it's a nice afternoon blend."

I haven't yet tried to cook this rice dish on the stove, but although the microwave instructions require a bit of babysitting, stirring every few minutes, the end result is a slightly creamy rice and beans dish with a really great kick and aroma of cajun spices.  Unlike most of the rice (with pasta usually cut in) dishes on the market, you can really smell it cooking from a room away, and when you first open the foil package the mix is kept in to stay fresh, you get a blast of the spices as well.  You can tell at every stage that it's a high quality product, and it comes through in the end.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for either a great meal or a rice side dish for dinner."

It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86"">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86"">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix"

(I was in denial)!  Finally, I took my first swig...  In reality, it tasted sort of like a citrus soda that had been spiked with a couple teaspoons of hot sauce.  The spiciness gave a slight burning sensation to my esophagus, and a funky aftertaste lingered for a while after I had finished the beverage. Subsequently, ""rot gut"" began to settle in, and any lingering ""open mindedness"" that I still had toward this soda faded away exponentially...<br />As I type this review, the empty bottle sits next to me; I've now become acutely and unequivocally aware of the noxious smell continually wafting from the opening:  An unsettling hybrid scent of hot sauce and sickly sweetness.<br /><br />I like the novelity of this soda, but I don't think that I'll be drinking it again."

Generally speaking, neither of them are exactly treat-shy and will eat almost any snack you put in front of them. That being said, when I opened up the bag of Newman's and let them try one of the Lamb and Barley treats, they loved it. Usually with dry treats my dogs will sniff them and give you a look of ""Ok, this is nice, but where's the dried chicken or duck jerky?"" and only eat them after realizing that there's nothing else coming. With the Newman's Own, they sniffed them once and immediately started chowing down without so much as a ""What else ya got?"" look.<br /><br />While these treats are amazing and made with 95% organic ingredients, there are a few caveats. First they are very, very dry and hard. Each treat is made up of two squares, made to be breakable down the center scoring if you wanted to divide the treat up. Each square is approximately 1""x1"". Breaking apart the squares will help release a little of the odor of the biscuits - after the first time I gave the dogs these treats, they started snubbing them a bit until I would break a piece off. I think that perhaps the outer portion of the snack gets dried out and no longer has any smell that the dogs can detect (or it's really faint). Once you break them apart, the dogs recognize the smell and eat it up. Since they are so hard however - if you have an older dog with teeth issues, this is probably not the best treat for them.<br /><br />Second, since the snack is so dry, it is very crumbly. If you have a dog that only eats the chunks and never cleans up the crumbs, you'll have a mess to deal with every time they eat these. As my dog breaks apart the treat, it deteriorates into several pieces including minute crumbs. My dogs generally lick the floor until everything's picked up, but if you have a plush carpet, this might be something to consider.<br /><br />Other than that, my dogs love these treats and I'll probably be picking up more in the future."

I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his brand. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I brewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness.

1574,B0002TJAZK,A2ISKAWUPGGOLZ,M. S. Handley,1310774400,Kitty Junk Food,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

That is unfortunate there are no more canneries here in the States.<br /><br />Here's my reality:<br /><br />I believe this company is out to put out quality products. And if your really concerned about their business practice do some due diligence. They have a website.<br /><br />I stopped for years eating anything out of a can. And for a single person I can't afford buying wild fish in bulk. I love the fact that this company puts out this product. Being of a Pacific Island decent (born and raised in the U.S  and proud to buy american) the food my ethnic community eats is a horrible combination with all that msg and salt. Not all asians eat vegetables. Particularly Filipino's. They fry everything and eat too much bread. It's the spanish influence. I respect their dietary choices but it didn't work for me.<br /><br />About 10 years ago I gradually shifted my health. I believe in moderation. And I do research the companies I buy from. I've never considered sardines. Then I tried the Sardines in Olive Oil and I am hooked.<br /><br />I study the health benefits of all things. I've been doing it for 10 years now. I study psychology and do yoga.<br /><br />Health first comes from your mind. It comes down to testing and learning what your body likes. It doesn't help to scare people into health. It doesn't work in the long run. I've met health freaks that worry so much about the negatives that it physiologically affects their health. There is such thing as too much information. You have to enjoy what you eat. Simple.<br /><br />I eat this stuff out of the can. The flavor is fantastic. It's great with some brown rice and veggies. I haven't quite made the transition to totally raw and I don't think I ever will but this is the next best thing.<br /><br />Price is not comparable to the price of your health. Most don't know how to measure that. The way I watch people waste their money on things like eating out, booze and claim they save money to buy one dollar microwaveable meals doesn't compare. Those ""frugal"" individuals suffer long term when they get older. They are the same people that poke fun at folks like me who take supplements and do yoga. I see a long term investment that most people tend to neglect: YOUR BODY! Your health needs to balance on ALL levels: mind and body. That's when you reap the benefits.<br /><br />If you want great healthy food for an affordable price and still support the planet, then support this company. Your body in the long run will thank you for it."

(My dentist said the same - only he was able to make his announcement a bit more colorful by showing `worst case scenario' pictures of teeth on battery acid. He put me off coffee for a week.)  So, with that double-whammy in mind, I've lately been trying to cut back on acidic foods.  Hence my decision to go the low-acid coffee route.<br /><br />And like the headline says, this coffee is a good news bad news situation.<br /><br />First, the good news: Puroast Coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately low-acid.  I've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it.<br /><br />Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad.  I should note, this isn't the opinion of a coffee snob:  while I like a good cup of Peet's Coffee as much as the next guy, I'm a-okay with a batch of Folger's or the basic house brand of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in.  I'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isn't highway robbery.<br /><br />Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee ain't that pleasant kick start.  There's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe - other than to say that Puroast doesn't really taste like French Roast coffee.  Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains.<br /><br />So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.

But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it won't smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I've made vanilla salt before so I know what it's supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn't going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. I'm so disappointed. I haven't cooked with these seeds so I don't know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient.

Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get ""upset"" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!"

No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good.  No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells.  No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture.  They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free.  No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also.  According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well.<br /><br />That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff.  You're probably wondering what the catch is, right?  It definitely isn't the taste.  As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good.  I only see two drawbacks.<br />1) Cost.  Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected.<br />2) Quantity.  The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies.<br /><br />16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them.  However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us.  I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag.  Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating.  Even so, I still wish there were more in a package.<br /><br />One last note, just because I found it to be unusual.  Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight.  These aren't.  Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others.  There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space.  It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me."

I am very experienced, and these planters have excellent drainage. This year, I switched the potting soil out for Miracle Gro Moisture Control. I flooded the planters before putting the plants in - several times. I planted them, and watered every single day from necessity. This soil product felt moist, but none was shared with the plants - their soil root balls stayed bone dry. The 2 planters in full sun had dying plants. I plunged my arm at least 25 inches down into the planters and the soil was hotter than beach sand, all the way down. This product somehow retains heat and was cooking my plants. When I removed this soil, I was surprised to find big pockets of it that were dust dry. The 2 planters in shade did a little better, but no plant growth whatsoever. Maybe if the plants grew in this from seed, they would do better, but you can't put plants in root balls into it - this soil just won't let the moisture leach into adjacent soils. And it cooks them. If your plants are still alive, rescue them and replace the soil. I don't know what this stuff is, but I would definitely not eat anything grown in it."

Potter,1163376000,Best of the Instant Oatmeals,"McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey."

However, several bags did not pop correctly (or at all) and had to be thrown out.  Also, many other bags would have a burnt hole after popping.  I realize that some of this variability could be due to microwave wattage, but it was only bags from this large box of Orville Redenbacher's that would do this.

The calorie savings isn't even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. Also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil (if eaten in moderation) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. In my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. If you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip.

They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%"

As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron. Without enough iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen. As a result, iron deficiency anemia can leave you tired and short of breath.  The solution: boost your iron intake.<br /><br />One tablespoon of this tasty delight has 70% RDA of iron and it tastes pretty good too.

He wouldn't eat the new ones...and I can't blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product.

The box I'm currently drinking is so full of tannin and void of essence of bergamot that I don't know if it will actually be drunk. All boxes I've had contained tea bags with an ample amount of tea and each produces a satisfactory little teapot full of caramel colored tea, but I am having difficulty drinking the second cups from this box because the tea powder residue remains.

This is EXACTLY like those butterscotch hard candies from childhood!<br /><br />I think if I had to pick one matcha that I would never share with others this would have to be the one. Although there are so many I have yet to try I think so far this is my favorite. I just made myself laugh though because I have said that with almost every new matcha from Red Leaf Tea I have tried. Seriously though, this is so very yummy, and sweet, and just really the one that I feel will always hit the spot for me! What is even more cool is that when I mix it in my latte concoction - which is how I usually have my matcha, the butterscotch flavor comes out even more and is not by any means hidden underneath the milk or vanilla creamer!<br /><br />I always do try matcha straight before mixing it in my latte and I will say that the butterscotch flavor is stronger in the latte mixture than straight which I found interesting and odd at the same time.<br /><br />I don't know how Red Leaf does it but their flavors are all natural and while I certainly appreciate the health benefits to matcha I am finding I reach for it more and more simply for the flavor but I can't deny the excellent energy boost! Its like an energy drink without all the sugar which means you don't come down and fall on your face later in the day!

I was expecting a little sample bag but received a full 10-oz sized bag.  Looking at the purchase price on Amazon, I think this is very fairly priced.  At $23.60 for a 6-pack, that is just a little under $4 for each bag which is very competitive with other dog treats - many of which have lower quality ingredients.<br /><br />Speaking of ingredients.....Lamb?  Barley?  Organic.  Okay, I'll admit it - I just had to try one myself.  They're hard so I had to soak it a little but they are actually quite good.<br /><br />My dog is a 45lb mutt who will eat anything, so it doesn't surprise me that he took one with alacrity and I didn't see it again.  I also keep chickens and it occurs to me that for a little protein boost, this would be a fun way to treat them too.  I'd have to soak them for awhile but I think they will also be getting a treat.<br /><br />The only thing I would like to see added is another version of this treat that includes glucosamine.  My dog has severe hip dysplasia and we supplement him with glucosamine twice a day.  He doesn't love the pills and administering them is not a fun job, but because we can tell a different when he's on them, we persevere.  However a treat like this that he wolfs down, that includes the glucosamine?  Now THAT I would be willing to pay good money for.

Betty Crocker has a Recipe website they've published for you using this product that has quite a few tasty treats you'll love. When it calls for Vegetable Shortening, be sure to use it, for example, biscuits made without shortening, and only butter will be very dry and not very satisfying, even difficult to swallow. Use recipes that include shortening, and will result in moist, fluffy foods and breads will help you end up with an enjoyable addition to your meal.<br /><br />Fun and Tasty Gluten Free Recipes for this mix can be found on the Betty Crocker website, they won't allow me to post the link here, sorry.<br /><br />UPDATE: ** Fun Tip about this and other Gluten Free Mixes, My mom Figured out that when you're mixing together your ingredients and you're using one that calls for milk, that if you mix together ONLY the BASE MIX and the MILK and let it set for about 15 minutes before continuing with your recipe and adding other ingredients, the end result is much fluffier and tastier **  This would be much like making tapioca pudding, you have to let the milk and tapioca soak to 'activate the tapioca' before moving on, so I think that type of reaction is what's happening here with the Bisquick Mix.

To name a few: Pumpkin Ice Cream, Pumpkin Bread and Muffins, Pumpkin Pie, Pumpkin Spice Latte (coffee), Pumpkin Cheesecake, etc. etc.  I recently started adding canned pumpkin to our Sunday morning pancakes, and was delighted with the results; however, I wanted a stronger pumpkin taste/flavor.  I found this product and excitedly ordered two bottles.  It arrived very quickly (within 3 days), and I just tried it this morning in our pancakes.  The flavor DOES NOT taste like pumpkin whatsoever.  It tastes like a chemical and leaves a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  I dumped both bottles down the sink and had to throw away the pancakes.  I was not able to eat them, they were terrible.  I was actually nauseated after trying to eat them.  I'm not a picky eater and have no allergies whatsoever.  I'm the type of person that will eat nearly everything, and cannot think of any food that I don't like.  I'm going to continue my search for a ""NATURAL"" TRUE pumpkin extract; however, this is definitely not it.  I hope this helps you, especially if you're as passionate about pumpkin flavor as I am.

There is a slightly detectable taste of strawberry and maybe kiwi.<br /><br />Pros:<br />100% Vitamin C<br />Low Sodium of 15mg<br />Tastes good if you like the light carbonated Perrier-Like Taste.<br />Fat: 0mg<br /><br />Cons:<br />33g of sugar (although it says no sugar added)<br />34g of carbs - too much carbs if you're trying to cut down on carbs<br /><br />Conclusion: Keep in mind that this review reflects my personal opinion of the product beside the facts listed on the can. I personally prefer less carbonated fruit drinks with a stronger taste rather than the very light taste of this product. it is 135 calories for 8.3 fl oz. You also feel you need a glass of water to wash out the after taste. Overall, it tastes good and I can recommend it to anyone who's not trying to cut down on the amount of daily carbs or sugar intakes."

It almost tastes like someone brewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.<br /><br />Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.<br /><br />I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.  But otherwise I have 3 more canisters to try and give away - if you haven't tried it, buy as small of a pack as you can for a taste test first."

I used to use the Purity Farms brand Organic Ghee, but find that this one has a much better flavor and texture.  I think this is due to it being pasture fed and non-homogenized which is probably not true for the other product.  It is a bit more expensive, but the benefits of grass fed cannot be overstated when it comes to Ghee.  The only other Ghee I would recommend is Ancient Organics which is also prepared in the traditional way, but it is a bit more expensive than this brand.  Ghee is also one of the only oils I would recommend using for cooking as it does not change its composition when heated.  A little every day can make a big difference in health over time."

Polk ""Savvy Sleuth""",1269993600,"Celsius ""YES"", but Orange Flavor is a ""NO"" for me","I started drinking one 12 ounce can of Celsius 15 minutes prior to weight and cardio workouts, and have found Celsius brand to be far superior to Monster in the energy boost it gives me.  Each 12 ounce can has 200mg of caffeine (check out the Celsius website...) so I don't drink any coffee on the mornings I'm off to the gym as when I do drink both, I tend to get jittery instead of 'boosted'.<br /><br />Celsius' fat burning claims come from the thermogenesis angle.  Meaning it will keep your metabolism fired up for a longer period of time (up to 3 hours post-workout) and thus you can potentially burn up to 100 extra calories.  It has ginger, chromium and green tea - all favored for their 'fat burning' properties, along with high vitamin C and B vitamins.  No sugar, no carbs, no preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fats and very low sodium (6mg) make this a good energy drink choice in my book.  THIS flavor however, makes me want to gag!<br /><br />Orange flavor is a 'sparkling' version of Celsius.  Slightly carbonated, it could taste like a soda - Fresca would be the closest thing to it in my mind - but for me it simply tastes bitter and tough to swallow.  I do generally like orange flavored drinks, so this surprised me. I also found I had an upset stomach after drinking it.<br /><br />I do like two of the non-sparkling Celsius drinks and would recommend you try a few flavors before buying a case of them.  My favorite so far is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSVOLM"">Celsius®, Raspberry Acai, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and if I can't find that one, I'll drink <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSRUPG"">Celsius®, Peach Mango, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Neither tastes bitter to me, nor overly sweet.  There is no aftertaste and my stomach tolerated them well.<br /><br />One thing to note when using this supplement, it does seem to act as a diuretic.  I have to urinate a lot for several hours after drinking just one.  They say on the website that you can drink up to 3 a day (that's 600mg of caffeine a day...) and do not recommend this drink to anyone who is 12 or under, or caffeine intolerant.<br /><br />Check out their website for studies relating to fat loss and this product."

""It is hard to get the coffee down without peanut butter"" she says. We have been using crackers like these Kavli crispbreads to ""get down the peanut butter"" since before I can remember - I think it was when Dan and Mary Eads published: ""Protien Power Plan"" in the late 1990s. Many years ago we found these to be the best. We could only find them in Wegmans grocery store in NE Pennsylvania, and now that the Army has moved us (again) to Fort Knox, KY we can only find them at Kroger. Recently we cannot seem to find them there either, so we order them. They come fast, not broken, and they are fresh. Also, they are not any more costly to purchase online and pay for delivery than to waste time looking for them. One note: My wife hates opnening things, and we found the best way to do so with these is to cut off the end of the cellophane(?) with scissors - prevents cracks of this thin bread!"

I was expecting the usual dried out lackluster vanilla flavor I have ""enjoyed"" from the super market spice rack, but these beans are so much better.  I used to live near a natural food store that carried an excellent selection of fresh  spices, unfortunately with the recession they closed down.  These beans rival those that I could purchase there.  They have a robust vanilla flavor that came through very nicely in the ice cream I made.  I was used to doubling up on the beans in the recipe to get the vanilla flavor I wanted, but quickly found out that I didn't have to with these beans.  Highly recommended ! Enjoy!"
1872,B003I5XMLI,A4MQSC74WMZDZ,Kyle Nicholson,1313107200,Highly recommended cat food,"I used to work in a specialty pet store, and cats were my specialty. I was the expert on diet after spending much time researching various foods, reading labels, and talking to customers. I'll share what I learned, and explain why I recommend this food. Science Diet is one of the worst foods for cats, and right down at the bottom you'll also find Purina, Meow Mix, Eukanuba, and Iams. These have by-products, fillers (corn, soybean mill run, corn gluten, grits, or white rice).<br /><br />Many of the better foods like Blue Buffalo, Artemis, Wellness, Instinct, Orijen, California Naturals, Innova Evo, Merrick, and my personal favorite Vet's Choice Health Extension are world's apart in quality and most are cheaper than Science Diet pound for pound in many stores.<br /><br />These are the ingredients for a typical Science Diet bag minus the vitamins/minerals, just to give you an example:<br /><br />Ground Whole Grain Corn, Chicken By-Product Meal, Animal Fat, Dried Beet Pulp, Soybean Oil, Dried Egg Product, Flaxseed.<br /><br />Corn is a filler, and it's the number one ingredient. By products are things like beaks, feathers, etc. They're waste products. The only decent ingredients are down the ingredient list, meaning that they exist in a smaller amount then the first ingredients. Now, let's look at a bag of Health Extension that's both cheaper AND of higher quality:<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brown rice, Oats, Dried Egg Product, Chicken Fat, Flaxseed, Menhaden Fish Meal, Herring Oil, Sweet Potato, Cranberries, Blueberries, Tomato Pomace, Natural Barley Malt, Apple Cider Vinegar, Goji Berry, Garlic, Astragalus, Ginger, Blue Green Algae + 6 kinds of probiotics.<br /><br />The potato is a nice binder and good for digestion. The oils and flaxseed are good for the coat being rich in Omegs 3's. The probiotics regulate digestion. The eggs and chicken are good sources of protein. You might not *need* some of the extra ingredients like Goji berry for example, but they're better than fillers and at the very least harmless to cats.<br /><br />I recommend this food because my cats love it, it's relatively cheap for a quality food, and the ingredients are top-notch. If you want better food, go with Instinct (which my cats love even better, especially the rabbit) but be prepared to pay much more. The absolute best would be to put your cats on a raw diet using pucks of meat prepared by various companies, or simply do it yourself if you've researched how to prepare it, but this is an even more expensive route."

That being the bonus of this tea, you can add half of what you'd normally add to Earl grey [cream, lemon, honey] and save yourself a few calories.<br /><br />This is not a watered down version of Earl Grey, just a delicate tea."

1875,B001LG945O,A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K,Jared Castle,1235606400,"Tasty refuel after exercise or liven up a lunch; 100% juice, 0% bad stuff","As part of Amazon's Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">Black Cherry</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">Orange Tangerine</a>. I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.<br /><br />Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.<br /><br />I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice</a>, for example.<br /><br />The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWQ"">essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4"">San Pellegrino Orange</a> although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.<br /><br />In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.<br /><br />BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9GB4Y"">Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda</a>, which has 170 calories per bottle.

One of the first things I noticed after baking with this flour is that I no longer ""bloated"" or had intestinal distress after eating the foods made with this flour. Soooo nice! My doctor recommended this flour to me, and I'm glad I followed his recommendation. I did an experiment to make sure that it wasn't a coincidence that after eating the Hodgson Mill Organic Naturally white flour I didn't bloat, become puffy, etc. I made some cookies and muffins using the Hodgson Mill flour, and I made the same cookie and muffin recipe with typical white flour (all the rest of the (organic) ingredients were identical). I had intestinal distress, bloated, and had facial and hand puffiness after eating the desserts with the typical flour. When the bloating subsided, I waited an additional 6-8 hours, and I ate the desserts made with the Hodgson Mill flour....nothing happened - no bloating, no puffiness, and I felt great. The Hodgson Mill flour makes you feel good after eating it. I'm delighted to find a flour that doesn't have an adverse reaction on me. ALSO! The flour bakes and cooks great. The texture is wonderful - actually better than typical flour. My cookies, breads, muffins, pie crust, brownies, gravy, etc come out wonderful with this flour. I receive a lot of compliments on my desserts when using Hodgson Mill organic flour. Sometimes people find it hard to believe when I tell them that the flour is organic and naturally white. They can't believe the flour produces such great results.<br /><br />The flour ships quickly and stores well on your pantry shelf. I keep it in the refrigerator after opening it.

But it all comes down to one point, how does it taste.  Let's face it, if it doesn't taste good we probably are not going to drink it, and our children definitely will not drink it, and that's just the honest truth.<br /><br />KIWI BERRY SWITCH<br /><br />Now, here is a flavor that I could get use to in a hurry.  This taste was bubbling with flavor and actually brought pleasure to my taste-buds.  It was rich and smooth, yet bursting with excitement at the same time.  It did not leave an after taste that was unpleasant, but left you wanting more.<br />The blending of the flavors in this Switch was excellent and definitely made this taster happy.I had my grandchild take a drink and she absolutely loved it and asked me to go purchase some.

I saw that she measured the ingredients ""incorrectly"" as she used the same measuring cup (generally used to measure liquids) for both the dry and the liquid ingredients.  She also used a whisk to mix the ingredients.  Amazingly enough, the pancakes came out fluffy, and I really liked it.  In fact, it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far.

They are light, sure, but kind of flavorless and powdery if you chew for any length of time.<br /><br />Brown rice flour or millet gives such a great depth of flavor, and it's an actual whole grain, not just a grain after all the protein and nutrients are taken out. Even white rice flour would be better.<br /><br />Corn starch, however is cheaper so I think that's why it gets used a lot.<br /><br />If you liked white flour, starchy foods before you went gluten free you might like these.

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness."

We serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal. 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering:<br /><br />Calories: 120<br /><br />Fat: 4.5<br /><br />Trans Fat: 0<br /><br />Sodium: 270<br /><br />Carbohydrate: 17<br /><br />Protein: 3<br /><br />For our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under 5 fat & 25 carb. This fits perfectly & the taste is superb. Baked in the oven, they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. All with no grease. We now keep these on hand instead of french fries. I know they cost more, but they taste better and they are so much healthier. We wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time."

Every can has small dents. The discounted batch I ordered and recieved appears to consist entirely of factory rejects. They were bought 02/2012 and have a 12/2013 best by date, so not that big of a deal. None of the cans are punctured, just small dents. The contents are currently GTG.<br /><br />I'd say if you are planning on eating these within a few months to a year or so of purchase, go ahead and do it. If not, I wouldn't trust dented cans beyond their best by date, or even really too far before then.<br /><br />As for the contents, same as you buy in the store. Wife and kid love them, which is why I bought it.<br /><br />The price has more than doubled since I got mine. Perhaps I just got a reject buy... Be warned."

It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal.

I wouldn't say it's the worst I've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee that's been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.

Not for the Folgers crowd but not for the gourmand either.  All in all, not bad.  My biggest complaint was the packaging.

Gimbal's is less expensive this way and superior in every aspect of a licorice jelly bean.  This is a LARGE quantity!!

Our first foray into the single-serve hazelnut world was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZKI"">Gloria Jean's Coffees,Hazelnut K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, which was absolutely awful.  We've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past, though, and vowed not to give up.  I ordered a sample pack of Wolfgang Puck's hazelnut directly from Keurig's website and hoped for the best.<br /><br />Thankfully, Hawaiian Hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water.  It is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming.  The hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut, which you'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted, but we've been disappointed in the past.  I'd never tried coffee from the Wolfgang Puck brand before, but our positive experience with Hawaiian Hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied, which is nice, but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found.  This suits me just fine since I enjoy a milder roast, but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much.<br /><br />We'll definitely be repurchasing this coffee when we run out."

We eat waffles about once a week.<br /><br />Apart from the fact that it tastes great (it has a little vanilla and malt mixed in), it has NO trans fat.  Some pancake/waffle mixes, such as Krustead's which also tastes really good, say they have no trans fat PER SERVING, but if it has partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients, there is still some (less than than 1 percent) trans fat per serving.  Stonewall has none.<br /><br />We used to have a store that sold it locally, but now we don't so I am glad we can get it online.<br /><br />The can comes with a recipe that is perfect for making two belgian waffles with no leftover batter.<br /><br />We just bought the regular mix but we are going to try the other flavors next."

What I'd rather have, and what I make at home frequently, is a normal fruit juice, such as pineapple (no sugar added) and sparkling mineral water.  It cuts the sweetness of the juice, has just enough flavor, a little fizz and is even good for you.  Switch, I'm afraid has none of this, it's just too sweet and has too much fake flavoring.

I hate the idea of teaching my child that everything MUST taste sweet (spinach, broccoli, peas, etc- they're always mixed with mango, pear, apple, etc- they always just taste like fruit.) I LOVE that he Amaranth Ratatouilli is not sweet at all- it actually tastes like vegetables!! My child loves it. We frequently mix it into other things- pasta, rice, etc. It's great topped with cheese. One bit of warning though- this blend seems pretty acidic, so babies with sensative tummies might have trouble- I would just mix it in smaller portions with pasta or something else."

That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we'd give it a try for our cats.  I'd had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really ""feeling better"" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it'll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life."

Pop is full of CO2 (carbon dioxide), something our body is trying to get rid of, and refined sugar (which can ruin the teeth and provides empty calories). But even so, I still love it. I love the fizz tingling down my throat while while cleaning my palate and replacing it with sweetness. Nutri-sweet brings down the calories at the expense of flavor and has side effects like headaches and giving me a gnawing hunger.<br /><br />For fun occasions, I'll mix lemon-lime or plain soda water with juices for a delightful, and slightly healthier alternative to soda. Will the Switch Orange Tangerine soda live up to my expectations? A carbonated juice in a can?<br /><br />At first glance, the Switch can is...cute. It's a slender can with nice artwork. Fun to hold in your hand when you're used to the typical can.<br /><br />But when I taste it, I'm sorry to say, I'm a little disappointed. The Orange Tangerine Switch soda is not as tasty as regular orange soda, nor as orange juice. For a disclaimer, I'll mention that orange juice is not something that would normally taste great carbonated, so the other flavors of Switch might taste better. I got a kind of odd, bitter taste as I drunk the soda, but afterwards there was a pleasant aftertaste. The bitterness might be present in regular soda, but this is orange juice (with some others mixed in) and I know how it tastes without carbonation.<br /><br />I gave the Switch soda to both of my daughters who happily swigged it down with no concern from the odd taste I noticed.<br /><br />So while I won't be happily exchanging my occasional soda for Switch, I'm glad they are trying to do something a little healthier than we can feel more comfortable giving our children.

The bag lists a lot of features, like Organic, No Wheat, No Corn and Baked in Small Batches, but it doesn't say why these things are beneficial. The back of the bag has a fictional story about Newman's dog rumored to be writing a Tell All book. I assume it must appeal to Newman's target audience, and I'm not in that audience.

The cans themselves are awfully small, but the taste is truly big. It's made from 100% juice with no added sugar, corn syrup, or artifical sweeteners, yet plenty sweet enough naturally for most people's taste I'd think. My 12-year-old son loves it too. A terrific, natural drink. Ingredients include apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, rasberry, and strawberry juice concentrates reconstitued with filtered, sparkling water. It's all natural though they have added vitamin C so that it provides 100% RDA. A most excellent drink I'll continue buying for a very long time."

Since I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesn't make it easy to deal with)."

I love to have these on hand for they come into play so nicely in so many recipes. Always a joy to have a good ""crunch"" in some recipes. One of my favorite ways to use this larger can is to wrap a piece of bacon around them and secure with a toothpick. Then I dip them in a Apricot Ginger marinade and put in the oven until the bacon is crisp. My family loves an appetizer dinner once in a while and this is one of their favorites. Be mindful that this is a larger can so have a couple of recipes in mind for them when opening, although they do stay fresh in the frig for a while."

I buy Rolland and Seasons ( both sold by Amazon ) and in my opinion they are superior in both taste and texture.  It is a toss up for me as to skinned and boneless opposed to the skin on with bones - I like both - there are probally more nutrients in the ones with bones, which, along with the omega 3s is the plus factor for sardines.  They work for me.  I have eaten them since I  was a kid - I'll turn 80 in July. Incidentally, my cat is crazy about them too."

We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a ""rounded"" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way.

It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.<br /><br />Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch."

(Which usually means I have to eat three at a time *giggle*)  I'm glad to see Amazon has them in stock in case I can't find them locally; unfortunately, though, shipping them runs a risk of them melting, even in fall/winter. Alas, the chance would still be worth taking in order to get some this year. :)"

After experimenting a bit, and reading lots of recipes, I've come up with a simple, yet tasty way to prepare McCANN's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. Give it a try, and you may decide that oatmeal can be a healthy and delicious addition to your breakfast menu.<br /><br />Recipe:<br /><br />- Start by bringing 3 cups of water to a boil (about 3 minutes in the microwave).<br />- In a medium saucepot, melt 1 tablespoon of butter then add 1 cup of oats. Toast the oats on medium heat for about 3 minutes.<br />- Add the boiling water to the toasted oats and simmer for 25 minutes. Don't stir. It should get to a soft bubbling simmer.<br />If it boils to hard, you stove is set too hot, so turn it down or it will burn.<br />- Add 1 cup of milk (or can do with a mix of milk and buttermilk).<br />- Cook an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br /><br />Makes 4-5 good size servings with excellent texture and consistency. It thickens once it sits a little bit. You can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired. You can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste. Just store in small sealed bowls. Each can of McCANNs oatmeal makes about 16-20 servings.<br /><br />Everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently (sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, raisins, etc.). Only add the toppings when you're ready to eat it, not before storing in the refrigerator. For my serving, I like to add 2 tsp of brown sugar, a sprinkle of cinnamon, about 1/2 tbsp of butter, and then top with chopped pecans. Very tasty. Hope you enjoy!<br /><br />Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful."

It has worked very well in all our orzo recipes, hot and cold, save for one that was just OK. It has a stronger flavor than regular pasta made with bleached flour, so it does best in recipes with bolder flavors. Like most wheat pastas, it needs to be boiled for just the shortest amount of time, so that it remains very firm. We haven't overcooked it yet, so I can't say if it will get mealy and mushy like a lot of wheat pastas do. Highly recommended."

The noodles involved a little more chewing than I expected (and the texture is a little different), but it was enough to feed one adult such as myself and I liked that the noodles have 0 calories.

Mellow yet intensely flavorful, this tea works very well with iced tea makers or coffee brewers. I wouldn't use a coffee maker that's been used for coffee, though, as the coffee effervescence will overpower the tea's flavor. My only gripe is I would like to see loose tea available in larger packages. Lipton used to sell it in one pound boxes, but now it's only available in 1/2 pound boxes. This six pack helps make up for the problem somewhat. We drink iced tea like some people drink their coffee: all the time!

I figured once King B was gone so was my beloved jerky, but luckily Jack Links has brought it back. This jerky is above and beyond any of that overly-sweet bagged jerky Jack links sells. No, instead this is the way jerky should be, nice and chewy and salty yum. I know some people on here complained about the saltiness but I don't think they're overly salty, they're just plain delicious. Order some, you won't regret it."

2253,B000084ETV,A3NTV9VHMBY1KH,"Kimberly A. Kubek ""Doodle lover""",1175731200,Very good ingredient list with extras.,"I have a Goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side, so I started researching dog foods. I found that what he was on, was not really good for him. The second ingredient was ground corn and I found out that shouldn't be in the dog food at all. It's all filler, non-digestible...filler in, filler out. Through this surfing and sifting of information, what was good, explanation of terms, and eager for any information I could get and then pursue, I ended with Canidae All Life Stages Dry. There were others under consideration, but considering cost, balanced with good nutrition, supplements included in the food, and availability, I opted for Canidae.<br /><br />Of the top five ingredients, before the fat (in this case chicken fat), three are animal protein meal, Chicken, Turkey and Lamb meals. The other two ingredients are Brown and White rice, good easily digestible grains. My understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process. Meaning when your ingredient list - lists chicken first, that is precooked weight. After cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking, the ingredient list would not come out looking as good. Chicken might not be as high in the list. If a 'chicken meal' is listed, they start with the same grade of chicken, generally speaking, however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down. This is the same for any 'meal' protein. A 'meal' protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down, the water cooked out of it. So a 'meal' protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein, which won't be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together. Five lbs. of chicken, may end up to be 4lbs, however 5lbs of 'chicken meal', stays 5lbs.(this is made up example for clarity, not based on any math or science). The ingredients go on to list additional herring meal, vitamins, probiotics (for good intestinal health), natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couple.<br /><br />Beforehand, Riley was less than excited about meal time. He would pick at it almost from the beginning, walk away, come back - a little more eating and allot of drinking. Now, he eats it.<br /><br />A big benefit and another part of the reason for a search, is the reduction in feces. He was going 6 or 7 times a day and no small amount. We are down to two - four times/day so far. Improvement in condition of feces also. Firmer, more normal coloring, less of it. It seems like his body is getting more out of his food.<br /><br />He seems to have an improved activity level. His playfulness is increased, but not hyper by any means. Just healthier? perhaps. Calms right down on command, even around the other dogs.<br /><br />So far so good for this change. I have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change, but so far so good. He doesn't shed, so I'm watching carefully for any new hair loss. I won't wait it if occurs, I will take him off. I certainly would say, conditionally, this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality food.<br /><br />** It's been about 2 months now on Canidae.  Riley is still looking good.  No sudden hair loss, healthy, energetic, eating as I type...Still happy with this decision, and am still using it."

The choices were minimal:  Tea, tea with lemon, lemonade and pink lemonade.  At my job we have an area set up so employees can buy snacks and this variety pack.  Tired of soda, I opted to try the Crystal Light On the Go Wild Strawberry-Energy.  I instantly LOVED it.  This is coming from a person who really doesn't care for strawberries.<br /><br />Unlike another poster I didn't find it too strong.  I DO find the Cherry Pomegranate a tad powerful, but still yummy.  The last two-lemonade and raspberry lemonade- are also delicious.<br /><br />Having tried the Wild Strawberry at work I thought I'd see if Amazon had it and it did.  While I know purchasing an item this way is more expensive per serving, I prefer it this way.  When I make a pitcher of a drink I tend to get tired of it and it ends up going down the drain.  Now THAT is a waste of money!<br /><br />If you like Crystal Light then I'm pretty sure you'll like these flavors.

The first sip left me with an extremely unpleasant aftertaste, but had gotten easier to tolerate with additional sips.  But, after waiting a while for another sip, that initial unpleasantness returned.  If I'm going to drink juice, I'll stick to what I prefer, uncarbonated."

Basically, it's carbonated fruit juice from concentrate, or as they say: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola [cherry] juice concentrates).""<br /><br />Gone is the usual second ingredient in such beverages: ""high fructose corn syrup"" or the old standby ""sugar""...<br /><br />Basically, it reminds me of a carbonated version of Tropicana Pure or one of the Odwalla beverages, watered down just slightly (not quite as sugary, but still pretty darned sweet).<br /><br />Overall, I rather liked it. It's a bit smaller than your typical Pepsi or Coca-cola can. But I could see it being handy for kids' lunches and such. Slightly better than typical ""soda"" with corn syrup. Though I'm not sure whether it would be preferable to straight up fruit juice...<br /><br />Personally, I'd rather have the fruit juice (like a Hansen's smoothie or something, granted they're a bit sugarier)... But some folks like carbonated beverages. So, why not make one out of actual fruit juices rather than all sorts of more artificial stuff?<br /><br />Rather liked the Orange Tangerine one.

I was hesitant to try them given the one review about being distrustful of their composition so  I bought some from vet and used them side by side with ones from Amazon as a test.  I can find no evidence that these aren't genuine.  They are flexible, and the dog makes no distinction between vet's and Amazon's. We use a lot of these given number of daily pills consumed, and every package I've purchased has been fine. We purchase the large capsule size because some of dog's pills are quite large and then just pull off pieces of the pocket for the smaller pills.  I'll continue to buy them on line because of the difference in price with vet and because I can order in the middle of the night if necessary."

I noticed our dogs would occasionally chew grass at the park or leaves from trees, considering the chemicals that may be used on other plants I decided to grow my own.<br />My little guys love this stuff, but there is one problem being dogs they can be a little messy and they tend to want to rip the grass right out of the pot roots & all.  I have taken to trimming the grass daily and placing it next to their water bowl.<br />Trimming just seems to stimulate the grass to grow faster, much like your lawn.  As with your lawn I find that adding nutrients (Iron) to the grass it keeps it's beautiful color and many months of fresh new grass.<br /> Don't know the exact reason my dogs like grass, it might be just like humans we like a salad for a change maybe it just add something that is missing from their diets.  Guess you might say ""Dogs can't live on meat alone"" or something like that."

I also like that it takes up less storage space than those carousels plus a machine.  I have limited counter top space and it is already crowded.<br />A minor issue, as I had read before, was that the added height to the machine causes lid to hit the cupboards while opening and closing. I am OK with pulling it away from the wall a bit and will eventually place my machine in a more open counter space to avoid this.  It does bother my husband more though.<br />I was disappointed with the product a bit.  My main problem was the material on the top of the drawer, that you rest the machine on, was not done very aesthetically.  AS soon as I opened what stood out to me was that it had to have been hand cut, and was cut slightly wrong on my product.  First I can still see the pencil mark all across the front.  Then it was cut too short and  coroner was not cut squarely.  It happens to h ave also been across the front edge of my product so it just sticks out to me and lessens it's appeal.<br />I find the drawer to operate smoothly and easily.  you can not reach the back row of K-cups while full but that is not a big deal to me at all."

One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 packets in a box, that gives you 4, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this."

The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste.

I've been looking for a good quality dog food (rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor.com) without going into debt purchasing it!  I was feeding them a different brand that was ""breed-specific"" food, but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere.  A few places, if they carried it at all, only carried the very small bags (2.5 lbs) and with two dogs, one bag would last about 3 - 5 days.  Plus these little 2.5 lb. bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb. bag  cost!  I tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me, but they conveniently ""forgot"" to place the order, so I was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags.  Then I heard about Newman's Own Organics, which is rated a better dog food than the ""breed-specific"" food I was using and cost $$$ less!  And then I discovered that I could buy this food at Amazon.com, have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery - no brainer!!  No more running out of food, no more driving 50 miles or more to find it, no more hassels!<br /><br />And best and most importantly of all, my little guys LOVE IT!!

Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children."
2363,B001BSBFUO,AIUC6VT4VT01A,Karen,1314144000,These pill pockets literally saved our dog's life,"I was so relieved when I found this product. Our doberman was having serious skin allergies and had to take antibiotics and steroids in pill form. He was so crafty with the pills - we would hide them in wet dog food, only to find the food eaten and the pills spit out. We hid them in salami, raw meat, pastrami, turkey, soft cheese, hard boiled egg, anything that you could think of that is appetizing to a dog and he would eat the food and spit out the pills. It got so bad that he actually stopped eating and drinking. He was so sick. Our vet put him on IV fluids and steroids and antibiotics and these wreaked havoc on his liver. We were so worried. He was going down the drain. Then I found this product. Simple as that, we put the medicine in the treat and he wolfed it down. He actually got to the point that when the 6 hour time was coming around to ""get the treat"" he would start whining and staring at the refrigerator where I had prepared the whole dosage plan ahead of time and put them into a plastic box with big lettering, ""THIS IS ALEX'S MEDICINE - NOT CHOCOLATE!"" We had a close call with my little sister - they looked appetizing to her as well! :) Now I use these for his vitamins and for anything that he has to take that is not appetizing. Really a life saver!"

REALLY REALLY REALLY addicted to soda, so when these first came out a few years ago in cola, ginger ale and Lemon/lime i was quick to give these a try... The taste gave me nightmares, yes the taste actually gave me nightmares.  So after i finished the case i bought I was thinking i'd never drink them again.  But as of last year I got really serious with  my diet and remembered that these did indeed get me to sweat alot more, so i went ahead and ordered a 24 pack of these orange flavored ones.  Personally I think if you can stomach cola then your better off buying the cola flavor.  I hate cola flavor so I think this and Green Tea peach/Mango are the better ones.  They all taste awful to me and they give me a reason to keep going with my diet so i never have to consider drinking these again.<br /><br />So yeah they help, but the worst tasting drink ever in my opinion."

Quinoa can be used in a variety of ways, but one of our favorites is to make Quinoa Pilaf, the same way you would make rice pilaf. (Simply chop onions, carrots, and celery and saute in olive oil. Then add the quinoa and substitute chicken broth for the water and cook as per directions.) Quinoa is a great substitute for rice in general. This brand provides consistent results, always cooking evenly.<br /><br />TIP: When I open a bag and use a bit, I store the rest in a glass mason jar to keep it fresh.

And our dog, Lucky, can't speak...English.  I do, however, understand a little Dog speak.  When first presented with one of Newman's Own Lamb and Barley NZ Style Dog Treats, he snarfed it down just as expected, just as he does with all treats.  But the next day, as he  saw me go for the bag a second time - he went ballistic.  When I gave him the treat, he retreated into the den with it as if it were a bone.  Same thing happened the third time. Conclusion:  Lucky says ""Big Yum! to Newman's Treats.<br /><br />JMT"

Not very tidy and a little inconvenient, but the best I could do. I was thrilled to find this holder at the store (where it cost about $25 - beware some of these Amazon seller prices!) and bought it immediately. It's perfect! It holds 36 K-cups at a time, so I can stock it and put the K-cups away in the closet for a few weeks until I start running low. It also complements my black and silver brewer nicely. It's very stable and has a no-slip top so you don't have to worry about your Keurig tipping over. It does add about 4 inches of height, so make sure you have enough clearance if your brewer is under a cupboard. Highly recommended."

She goes bananas for these and learned very quickly even though she's a VERY stubborn pup. Since she's still small I cut the large cubes into thirds or quarters(she doesn't know and doesn't mind)to make our training sessions go further since it's recommended that you give only a few treats a day to avoid digestion problems. Also, compared to other liver treats on the market, this brand only uses 100% beef liver, no preservatives, fillers, or other stuff your dog doesn't need. The treats also keep indefinitely in the container if kept in a cool, dry place. The 21 oz. bucket is the most economical buy. We've had our pup 2+ months and the bucket is still mostly full.

2465,B00139TT72,A2EZW502SEA2N9,Linda Freitag,1226448000,Newman's Own Organics Dog Food,"I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.  For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.  I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority.  I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls.  I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.  I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food.  I also feed my two dogs Newman's Own biscuits as treats."

At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale. The price is only slightly better than what I can get the Davinci Brand at Sam's club but the quality is far lower in my opinion. For hazelnut fans I suggest avoiding this particular brand.

A little tart, but tolerably so.<br /><br />The flavor is less orange than tangerine, yet I can distinguish several different ""layers"" of citrus in it, including the orange. It's an interesting sensation.<br /><br />I am a little bugged by the fact that an 8.3oz can (2/3rd-size) manages to pack more junk calories in than a full-sized can of cola. It's also supposed to be 100% juice, but reconstituted grape juice is practically pure sugar and there are ""natural flavors"" noted in the ingredients list as well as a soy warning which to me implies some sort of MSG, probably added with the citric acid.<br /><br />So, maybe it's not an especially healthy beverage.

There is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees.  It's a smooth, mellow taste, even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa.  I really enjoyed this.  The grind is listed as extra fine, but I didn't find it particularly fine myself.  When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands.  However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried.  We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups).  This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable.  The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.

Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.

I used to avoid granola cereals because they were hard to chew.  A friend visited, brought a box of Nature's Path Pumpkin Flax Granola, and forgot to take it when he left.  So, I tried it.  I was hooked immediately.  Not only was it tasty, but it wasn't jaw-breaking hard.  It wasn't mush either.  Perfection.<br /><br />The only problem with this cereal is the price.  For someone on a fixed income trying to eat right, it's expensive.  It is hard to find it for less than $4-5/box and that's just too much for me to spend on a small box of cereal.  I bought this bulk package from Amazon when it was on a super sale, but on accident I didn't hit auto renew and the price went back up.  When it goes back down I'll renew, but until then it's other places that are cheaper.  These are Fred Meyer in bulk and Trader Joe's ($2.89/box).  The best price is Fred Meyer.<br /><br />Make sure that you chew the cereal good.  The flax seeds are whole.  If they enter the body whole, they EXIT whole as well, and that means you get zero nutrient from them.  So, chew it up!<br /><br />It's EXCELLENT with So Delicious Coconut Milk, a non-dairy, non-soy drink.  I just use it for this cereal.

2539,B001LG945O,ARNEUO7BF3J55,E. David Swan,1245715200,"Good Ingredients, Weak Taste","It's a small drink at just 8.3 ounces but that's probably the size drink we should all be consuming so I wont ding it on that point. It's made with good ingredients and as it says `No Sugar Added' but don't let that fool you into thinking it's low in sugar having 34 grams. A Coke contains 45g of sugar but it's almost 50% larger so even without adding sugar this is a drink that's fully loaded. In defense of The Switch at least the sugar is natural with no high fructose corn syrup. Obviously it has no caffeine which I have some issues with so that's a plus over soda although at 36g of carbs it seems a bit high and 140 calories is nothing to sneeze at.<br /><br />So it can't be considered a health drink since you can get lower sugar, carbs and calories from a similar size glass of Tropicana orange juice. So how is the taste? My wife described it as tasting like soap. I wouldn't go that far but I will say the despite its good ingredients it actually tasted artificial to me. I wasn't a big fan and personally I'm going to stick with water and orange juice.... and beer."
2540,B0045XE32E,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,Stephen M. Lerch,1298937600,Baird approved!,"Baird is my 1 year and few months old Shetland Sheepdog. His review of this product would involve a ton of tail wagging, enthusiastic sits, downs and any other trick he knows while he waits for me to hand him the treat!<br /><br />These treats seem to be really good. Baird loved them. They don't smell like dog treats. If you really sniff them yourself you can smell the hints of apple in them. Not having that nasty unnatural dog treat smell clinging to my hands for hours afterwards is a huge bonus as well.<br /><br />If you don't like to give your dog unnatural treats, this is definitely a good choice as every ingredient is certified organic. There is also NO CORN or other filler grains, which is also a bonus, especially if you ensure your dog isn't getting these grains in their regular meals. There's no point in keeping corn and similar grains out of their food if you're just going to hand off a treat that has those fillers.<br /><br />One down side is that, as other reviewers have stated, these treats are on the larger side. I'd say they are 1.5 x 1.5 inches in length and width once you break one in half. For a smaller dog, this might pose choking risks if they don't like to chew. I was worried about how Baird would handle them, but he's responsible in how he eats and chews everything really well. He's also a bit larger than a normal Sheltie. I plan on taking one over to my parents' house and giving it to their Sheltie Kiowa, as he is more the standard breed size for a Sheltie.<br /><br />I'd say, compared to say, Milk Bones, these treats are pretty pricey. However, with Milk Bones you get what you pay for; cheap treats. If you're OK giving your dog Milk Bones (I actually do as he enjoys them and I use them sparingly), you probably won't want to spend the money for these. If you try to ensure your dog has a healthy diet and want treats to match, these will definitely do the trick.<br /><br />Disclaimer - I received this, as it seems did many others, via Amazon Vine, which means I got the treats for free. This fact does not color my review as I treat every item from Vine as though I've paid for it. Plus I can't fake Baird's overly enthusiastic reaction. Though he acts the same way for Milk Bones as well, so who knows?"

My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.

Then, consider the discount(s) when purchasing through Amazon, and it'll be tough to choose another.  Why?  Many other brands charge the same price as -or more than Roland- with only a 3.5-oz tin, whereas Roland includes more fish in the tin.  The quality is consistent, and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir-fries, salads, pasta dishes, etc. without overpowering the other flavors.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I was half-mindful when perusing a semi-local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city.  I was looking to make some lower-cost and healthier choices in my diet at the time (not expecting to find these, of course, but rather turning my nose up at the usual crud I saw stocked there) when I accidentally stumbled across them.  At $1 per tin, it was a huge buy, so I tried a few.  The rest, as they say, is history as aforementioned."

My dentist has even stated my gums are looking healthier (no more bleeding gums) a first for me. On line with the teeth issue, these probably are to hard for those with loose or weak teeth.

They usually have a couple of flavors and are the smaller cracker not flatbread, but taste the same. Also over the years I have modified what I eat, first I started as a lo-carber, mostly eating my favorite meats etc., but my triglicerides were always high, so I started adding sardines & more nuts & fruits, skipping more often some of my favorites like fried chicken. But have found excellent & flavorful alternatives, dark chocolate Almonds, some Sara Lee breads, lo-carb brands of tortillas.I still fall off once in a while & eat out often, but always get back on course.

I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love.

I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>.

The regular coffees were very good better than many. I really liked the Amazonia and the Africana medium roasts, not so much the Colombian. The dark roast Eclipse, Mexican, and French Roast were very good. I made them into ice coffee, strong but not bitter. I didn't care for the Costa Rican light roast, it had an artificial taste to me. The House blend was good but nothing to write home about. I hate decaf so I used that K-cup to water my plants with, so as far as taste goes I have no idea but my plants perked up. The Chocolate raspberry went nicely into a chocolate cake batter in place of water and it was delicious. If priced right I'd buy them again."

It also makes a healthy and filling snack - adding a bit to yogurt or sprinkling it on other foods. Sometimes I'll even eat a tablespoon or so dry or with a half teaspoon of jam or jelly. I'm going to use this to make some super healthy snack bars (there are many recipes online) to replace the sugar-laden and expensive granola bars or energy bars I usually buy."

You know it's going to be good. I keep a coffee grinder on my kitchen counter. Personally I like to grind the seeds and add them to whey protein smoothies with chocolate, coffee, coconut, vanilla spice flavors. Toasted flax pairs very well with those flavors. Also delicious in yogurt with a drizzle of raw honey or maple syrup. I also love to mix together 2 Tbsp of ground seeds, 1 tsp of coconut sugar, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of cardamom and ginger to sprinkle on top of a bowl of creamy porridge. It makes a great nutty topping for cereals. Can be added to baked goods as well.<br /><br />I love this product! Not only does it taste phenomenal, but I also feel good about the nutritional punch of Omega-3, lignans, and fiber. Scientific research points to flax having a balancing effect on hormones and breast health.<br /><br />When I recently ran out of this TJ product, I tried another product to COMPARE quality, Spectrum's Organic Dry Roasted Premium Flaxseed, and was very disappointed -- twice. Just today (5/9/2012), I opened yet another bag of Spectrum (2nd try), and again the product not only smells rancid, but tastes inferior. Expiration date on the bag is 8/9/2013. Spectrum also adds salt to improve the taste. Salt does not help the Spectrum product, and I won't be trying it again.<br /><br />If you're going to try whole *roasted* flax seeds for the first time, then you should try this Trader Joe product first.

2589,B00622CYVI,A36UA434L423AU,"D. Dunlap ""Dave the Dad""",1305590400,BPA no longer an issue,"****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months.  Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best.  It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself.  The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy...  and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well.  All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read the review about BPA in the lids.  I spent some time trying to verify this myself.  A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me:  Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids...  their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question.  The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss.  That's only slightly paraphrased.  Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either...  nothing.  I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents...  something.  Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns...  just say something...  anything.  Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain.  Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review.  Their office was closed...  9AM - 7PM est.  Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />***UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least."

It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.<br /><br />I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more."

The results showed that this product passed for being extra virgin olive oil for all 3 samples, and it was the only imported oil to the United States of 14 tested that passed all 3 samples.  It seems to be more potent (because it's spicier) than the, Trader Joe's organic brand which cost 40% less.  You do know that about 80% of all extra virgin olive oil products are not 100% extra virgin olive oil.  Five stars because it's a decent price and I trust this product for being extra virgin more than other name brands.<br />This oil is from Italy, which means this oil is milled in October or November or December, as with all northern hemisphere olive oils.

I would not normally purchase this type of product, so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard.<br /><br />I'm not a big soda drinker, I'd just rather drink water or coffee. I will occasionally drink a diet soft drink, usually Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke.<br /><br />Did you know that a single 12oz can of Coke Classic® has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar? This 8oz can of Switch has 140 calories and 34grams of sugar. And this is healthy? 4 ounces less is size, same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that Classic Coke. OK, so it's not ""added"" sugar, but still, that's a lot of sugar. 100% Orange juice, 8 oz, has 120 calories and 28 grams of sugar.<br /><br />The can says it is ""Orange Tangerine"" but in fact the contents are #1: Water #2: Concentrates of Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola juices. Then they throw in some ""gum acacia"", ""natural flavors and colors"" and some ""ascorbic acid(vitamin C)"". And as a little surprise bonus, they have added ""soy"". Soy?<br /><br />I asked my wife to taste this product with me. I poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip. Her reaction was swift and strong... she hated it. I agreed with her. It was for me, sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth. Not only that, but the taste was just nasty. It didn't taste at all like orange or tangerine to me. It just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste. The carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience. Neither of us finished drinking our 4oz portion. It went down the sink.<br /><br />I would not purchase this product in the future and if I could have given it 0-stars, I would have. It's that bad."

Instead of being solid brown, hard and crispy, the beef liver pieces are soft, pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them.  I'm afraid to feed these to  my dogs or other dogs that I meet in the park.  I've been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn't look and feel right.  I'm going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch.  One thing I did notice when the package arrived and that is the long, tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn't fit the 6 pouches very well.  My guess is that another manufacturer is making this dog treat, not the original one and that's the reason for the inferior and unhealthy quality of the treats."

If you've read this far you are waiting for me to say how bad it was. You can't imagine how bad it is. Without exaggeration I would describe the flavor as a very bitter tasting dirt. Yes, as a 32 year old with children I know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink. My recommendation is to let it steep for a shorter amount of time as to not make a rich bold tea. As you know, the longer it steeps the bolder the tea becomes. Yea, don't do that with this.

I want to taste my food and know it's healthy, than not want to taste my food while knowing it's healthy. There was plenty of chocolate in the bar for me and it wasn't concentrated in chunk or random chips. The chocolate pieces used had melted nicely, so the chocolate was very prevalent throughout.<br /><br />I definitely could taste the coconut, but it was a more fresh flavor than say something you'd buy in a bag at a store. It also did not overpower the rest of the bar. Coconut is a powerful ingredient. It's good to know it was used in moderation. The oats and the cookie part of the bar lend well into reminding me of a great oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I could take a bite and got plenty of the cookie texture I want more of, with bits of oat and smaller but still flavorful coconut.<br /><br />I think it'd work well to think of these less as a bar (like a healthy food bar) and more of a great tasting, small cookie."

First of all this is NOT what NASA eats as their regular food supply. They do in fact have real fruits and other things like meat products and they do have freeze-dried snacks to reduce the weight on the space shuttle. this food is extremely light weight as compared to traditional foods. On a space shuttle launch every pound costs thousands of dollars so literately every pound counts. I would see this being a good snack pack for the crew of a space shuttle on the bridge or other space craft crew or the I.S.S(International Space Station)teams. But let me explain what exactly you are supposed to get in this sampler. Two 4inchesx4inches freeze dried astronaut ice cream squares one green mint chocolate chip and the other strawberry/vanilla/chocolate combo flavor, and one freeze dried ice cream sandwich. You also should get two astronaut space food energy bars with a refrigerator magnet. One chocolate and the other peanut butter. So basically what they show in the picture is what you get in this food sampler. But if you ask me it did make me thirsty. So I would drink a good amount of water after eating this stuff. Oh and FYI the ice cream is broken up into peaces so you can eat smaller peaces of of it. So my opinion is great sampler for the money. Just have water with yours."
2681,B001PO7FIU,A1H4NF2OI9P8P7,J. MACLEAN,1249257600,A flavorful alternative to extra virgin olive oil for high temperature cooking,"I bought Avocado Oil specifically for two reasons: one, because it is very similar to olive oil in texture and smell, yet brings a new flavor component to my cooking, and secondly and most importantly for me . . . it has a much higher smoke/burn point than extra virgin olive oil--even higher than Canola oil, grapeseed oil and yes, even safflower oil. I've also read that it's just as healthy. The smoke point of avocado oil is somewhere north of 500F! Roughly 520F in fact. That's amazing, and gives me the versatility I need to quick-fire or sear virtually anything under high heat. La Tourangelle's Avocado Oil, one of the few I've tried, tastes great! Fresh and subtly aromatic.<br /><br />Basically, this has been the cure to my burned olive oil blues. That's an especially nice thing, since I have a hyper-sensitive smoke detector and have little room for error when it comes to smoke. To sum it up, though I don't always cook with it (I still use olive oil for low and medium temperature cooking), I love having avocado oil close at hand, for those times when I need it. It actually won't replace your olive oil though, because it has a somewhat different flavor, but it is a flavor I love. Avocado oil is ingenious (and a somewhat new discovery), and La Tourangelle is a trusted producer of the finest of fine edible oils. I trust their brand for some other less well-known oils as well.<br /><br />Highly and enthusiastically recommended--to the point that I'm trying to persuade my family and friends to start cooking with Avocado oil."

I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did.

These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!"

I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said ""natural"", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong ""mint"" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water.

If your plan is to just rinse them and fillet them and then down them with a piece of pugliese bread dripping in extra virgin olive oil and a glass of chianti then these will work for you also. Putting them on pizza is not what they are intended for. The variety of their uses is vast if you have any knowledge of Meditteranean cuisine, if not get yourself a good cookbook and learn, the flavors they impart are without comparison, not to mention the aromas they send out floating around the neighborhood."

I then added spaghetti sauce and cooked chicken and simmered it for some more time.  It was not like a meal at an Italian restaurant; but when you consider the caloeies and carbs being saved, it was quite palatable.  The only thing I really missed was the buttered garlic bread!

2765,B004565GV8,A107O68VE2HS1,Lawrence Devere,1300838400,I really wanted to love this gum..,"Initially, the flavor is fairly accurate, however weak- from there, the flavor diminishes rapidly. I just timed it, and this gum goes flat within 5 minutes.<br />In light of my experience, I find these rave reviews somewhat... amusing; one reviewer even went as far as to describe it as ""incredibly tart"". Meh.<br />Like many new products in the realm of gum, pop, energy drinks, and fast food, they only need you to buy one. If everyone does that, they'll be sitting pretty.<br />Based on this experience, I have no desire to try the other flavors of Extra Dessert Delights.<br />Three stars = It's OK, but doesn't live up to the hype."

It is not as dark as I normally buy, but it stands up quite well using my espresso machine (an inexpensive non-pump).  I was surprised at the crema it produced.  In short, it's everything I look for in a delicious cup of coffee."

2769,B002GWHGBQ,AZG9NISRWJB6F,bridgebuddy,1287360000,Great Decaf,"Use only strong decaf in the morning, but often like a flavored decaf in the evening.  Needs to stay robust as that's what my wife prefers.  Both the flavors in this decaf are subtle and do not mask the good coffee flavor.  This is probably the most robust flavored decaf we've found.  I'd recommend without hesitation as it was also a good value."

2775,B001EO653M,A2C8QA2LOENFXM,p.s.,1349222400,Tasty Iced Spiced Chocolate,"I got the 3lb bag and the recipes on the bag call for ""scoops."" A scoop was not provided in my bag, but they say that 2 scoops is equivalent to about 8 tbsp. However, the nutrition information is given by 38g serving, not by tbsp or ""scoop."" I measured it out with my food scale and 38g came to exactly 3 level tbsp, so if I made the Iced Chocolate as directed (2 scoops/8 tbsp), I'd be getting almost 3 servings of chocolate mix (420 cal before the milk!). I cut the milk in half (3oz hot and 4oz cold) and use one serving (38g/3 tbsp) chocolate, served over ice, and to me it is delicious with a nice strong spicy chocolate flavor, and it is a reasonable 217 cal when using skim milk.<br /><br />Different palates are going to have different preferences as far as the balance of spice and chocolate, but I can tell you that I like it. My husband does not care much for cinnamon but he also likes it, and my children like it too. We have only tried it cold so far and are looking forward to trying it hot!"

One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other ""Jamaica grown"" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price."

2786,B0028GY93S,AA1JJNJ5VYI97,Angel,1324080000,Love this food!,"My main reason for purchasing this dog food was that I wanted a food made here in the U.S., of natural ingredients and not made in a plant where chemicals are processed.<br />Recently I have lost 2 of my beloved small animals to a company who produces pet foods in the same plant as chemicals, pesticides, and other cleaning agents. It is my belief that carelessness and greed led to contaminated small animal food that killed my 2 pets.<br /><br />I have a 65lb German Shepherd/Aussie mix with a leg injury, and joint problems. She has always been very active & full of energy for her age of 8 years old. In the past I've tried either making her food or searching out holistic foods that are made here in the U.S. with natural ingredients.<br /><br />We started out with a small bag of this food at first to see if she would eat it. Immediately she loved it! She had no stomach upset, even though her stomach is sensitive. Right away her coat started getting softer & shinier. There wasn't as much problems with her joints and leg injury as before and I did notice even more energy in her!<br /><br />Now that I've been feeding her this for a while her coat has continued to soften, looks shinier & no more scratching! She's maintained her regular weight without gaining any. Her energy level is amplified and she's showing very little discomfort in her joints & with her leg injury. What I love best is that she eats every last bite of this food when its feeding time, when before she would only pick at her food. I've fed her other brands of holistic, natural and organic foods and none of them were this much of a hit with her. This food really has made a difference in her overall health, coat and energy levels. None of the other foods made her coat this soft!<br /><br />These are bite sized pieces of food that an older or smaller dog would be able to eat. Mine doesn't like big chunks of food, she prefers the smaller bites so this one is perfect for her. Oh, and upon opening this bag the scent is like meat not bread or preservatives in other foods. This food isn't greasy either like many of the others we've tried in the past that leave stains on the floor if it drops and she misses a piece.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this food to everyone who has a small or large dog. The differences you will notice right away in your dog will make you a believer in this food as well!"

My child does not like anything ""sparkling"" but if I had kids who liked soda, I would probably try to move them over to something like this (actually, probably to water or sparkling water with a splash of juice) for special occasions...<br /><br />The flavor is very sweet (even though it is ""natural"" from the juices) and very tasty... The carbonation is light and sparkling- the flavor and carbonation reminded me of Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Cider, but a little more fun..."

I'd say it doesn't for me cause it's just a 3oz size afterall and I'm used to eating a lot more.

Is it worth it? Not really. First of all, you drink juice for health reasons. Vitamins, frutose over corn syrup and the like. Carbonating beverages generally aren't considered good for you, so it's odd that the two would be mixed.<br /><br />Besides the carbonation, and the aluminum can (which has been proved can lead to Alzheimer's) there's a lot of deceptive marketing going on. The can claims that Switch is 100% juice, but it's not actually 100% Orange and Tangerine juice. In fact, the drink is mostly apple and grape juice. You can taste this instantly, along with the metallic tang of being in a can. This is done because both of those juices are quite cheap in comparison to orange and tangerine. So really, you're getting more a a carbonated fruit punch then an orange tangerine drink.<br /><br />You're also gettinbg ""Natural flavours and colours"" which kind of kills the whole ""100% juice"" claim.<br /><br />With a taste that is both metallic and not really resembling the flavours it claims, I can't really recommend this product, You can generally buy boxed 100% juice for less, which contains more flavour, no aluminum and no carbonation."

I love this digestive ghee because I can make regular black tea and add the digestive ghee & a little sweetner and it makes a nice chai tea.  It warms me up during the cold and dampness and another added benefit..my stools come out much smoother..and constipation is usually eiliminated completely when I use it consistently. They also have ghees for recipes with chicken, fish and stake.  I've used these other ghees in a few receipes for chicken soup, on salmon and of course, lamb stew..I enjoy it very much.  Yes, they are sold separately from the regular ghee. Oh, they also have very small sample sizes to try before purchasing a large size."

They, if I may be so bold, are the perfect combination of soft milk chocolate and creamy peanut-butter - the absolute perfect ratio of yummy goodness.  The fact that Hershey's only puts these out 4 times a year is either 1)marketing genius or 2)sadistic and hurtful.  Do I recommend you buy these?  Yes - yes I do, especially if you love Reese's and want to experience that next level.  I vote that Hershey's design more of these - President's Day anyone?  Independence Day?  Groundhog Day?

Therefore, I can't honestly say that she ""liked"" Newman's Organic Lamb and Barley treats ""more"" than any other snacks I've given her over the years.<br /><br />However, I can say that I felt better about offering them to her!  First of all, a ""Nutritional Facts"" comparison showed them to be superior to some of the common store brand biscuits that I've bought in the past.  Secondly, they smelled better (I'm tempted to use the word ""fresher"") than some of the other brands.  And finally, she digested them well.  I don't feed her table scraps or people food aside from an occasional raw or frozen carrot, and I don't switch her regular food very often, because her system is fairly sensitive to changes in her diet.  She handled the Newman biscuits with no problems at all.<br /><br />I would probably feed her these treats on a regular basis if price were no object; however, these are a premium product and are priced accordingly.  What I will do is purchase them when they are on sale, just as I do a couple of other premium brands.  Definitely recommended!"

Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past, but I was game to try them again.<br /><br />I believe in organic treats, but if the girls don't eat them, it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition, I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low-calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit-y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.<br /><br />As I opened the two packages of Barksters, one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps, I was glad to see two things on the packaging:<br /><br />1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important, especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.<br /><br />2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.<br /><br />The second is most important for my ""grand-dog"" Dutchy, the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten-free diet, which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.<br /><br />As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon, I broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes - very puffy - and wafer-like, instead of a biscuit. And, I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.<br /><br />The wafers tended to break, but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was broken in two, that just meant two treats - Bonus!<br /><br />The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces, which seems pricey. But, since it's a ""luxury"" item, I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats, especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their ""treatie-time.""<br /><br />I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!"

I did like that there was green onions in with the seasoning. This was better than the usual peas and carrots that are on the top of a Cup O Noodles.<br /><br />I didn't like the bowl that the soup came in. When it had hot water in it, it became really flimsy. I was afraid that the edge was going to cave in and I would get burned from the hot water.<br /><br />In the end, this was basically a Cup O Noodles soup. It tasted just like a Cup O Noodles except that they seasoning package was separate and you had to pour that into the soup before messing with water.<br /><br />At the moment, Amazon does not have a price listed for these so I don't know how cost effective they would be.

I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical.<br /><br />When I got the package, I popped a whole tablet in my mouth and let is swish around my entire tongue until it dissolved.  As for the flavor, if any of you have had Haw Flakes from any Asian market, that's what it tastes like.  For those who don't know, don't worry, it's nothing disgusting.  Kinda bland, to be honest.  After is dissolved, the first thing I tried was a lime.  Verdict: Sweet.  Not overly sweet, but still sweet.  Kind of like a lemonade just a tad of sugar missing.  Next up, apple cider vinegar.  Verict: Sweet.  Doesn't taste exactly like apple cider like some people say, but I see what they're saying.  Last test is cheese.  It tasted different, but not exactly a big change.<br /><br />As for how long it lasted, I would say after 30-45 minutes, it started to fade.  After an hour, it was gone.<br /><br />Bottom line, it was fun to try it out and I will definitely be trying out more things in the future.  As for hosting a flavor-tripping party?

Audio output sinewaves show up very clean and accurate under an oscilloscope, with peaks at 90 degrees (which is a good sign).  No hissing sounds at all, it's very quiet with a mic connected, high frequency-spectrum wise.  For the record, I bought a usb to Toslink output adapter to connect to the amplifier because integrated laptop/PC sound cards are usually noisy as hell.<br /><br />I think some people are using mics with very low sensitivity or crappy output sources (e.g. cheesy soundcards, amps, receivers or multimedia speakers), or even lousy, improperly shielded mic cables and blaming the unit, but who knows.  What I can safely say is, for the cheap price, the unit manages to produce an output that has a very high gain and runs virtually flat while covering the entire audio spectrum.<br /><br />WINDOW7 FUNCTIONALITY(updated):<br />At first, it didn't work with WINDOWS7 x64 Ultimate.  I kept getting a message about not being able to find a driver.  And at the time the Icicle website made no mention of Windows 7 compatibility (2 months later, they are saying it's compatible with XP, VISTA and Windows 7).  After nearly giving up, I found my old USB motorola cell phone charger cable lying around and noticed it had a similar mini-usb header to the that of the Icicle's.  I connected the Icicle using the motorola cable into my Windows 7 PC, and to my surprise it was recognized.  I actually got the idea when the Icicle began losing its USB connection (with the original cable) whenever I moved it around a lot.  Could it be the dinky looking USB cable included with the Icile causing intermittent disconnects or driver problems with Windows 7?  I'm really not sure at this point.  What I can say is that the Blue Icicle seems 100% reliable when used with the old Motorola USB cable.  Perhaps the Motorola cable makes better contact or has better shielding--who knows.  (I'm inclined to cut away the white insulation of the original Icicle cable just see if it's shielded to the USB's electrical ground source.  It wouldn't be the first time I find an unshielded USB cable.  Then again, it might be the mini-USB header causing the problem.)"

It would be less than half the cost to buy him 3 packs of the astro food at retail (museum shops).<br /><br />Check the bulk packs of 10 of the astro ice cream from the same supplier/seller.  These are about a 1/3 more expensive right now compared to the sampler but you get more than 3 times the quantity of astro ice cream.  I gave 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because it is a unique and sort of cool gift for someone who likes this astro ice cream. They would get 5 stars if the quantity was fair - say 5 of the astro ice cream which would be 15bucks at the gift shops then the other stuff and packaging is maybe worth the extra 5bucks.

I do not think they have a coconut - which is why I bought the Oskri.  Alter Eco is USDA organic, fair trade, vegan, gluten free, soy and GMO free, no chemicals at all, no emulsifies.

I had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave, but when I discovered they were not on the low-carb diet I'd switched to, I had to find something else to use as a substitute.  NuStevia products are what I chose.  I tried several other types of stevia, but NuStevia products seem to be the best so far.  The bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from NuStevia products.<br />NuStevia white stevia powder is super sweet, so you'll have to use it sparingly, and one bottle lasts a very long time.<br />I'm very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again."

The can has just over 8 ounces and may not be a large enough serving for those used to 12 ounce cans.

2997,B00141UC9I,A5L504DA1XL6F,Christian Stone,1267660800,Good deal on a great item!,"Well first, my dog loves these.  I made the mistake of giving one to him at night before bed, and now he flat out demands these before bed or he pouts all night. Why?  Well, it's basically a healthy chicken jerky.  The ingredients are good, and so is the quality!  I am very sensitive as to what is in pet foods I buy, and this is a great treat!<br /><br />And I do have a comment about the person who mentioned that they are made in China. My response is so what?  I actually think it is a good thing!  We treat chickens (as mean as they are) so poorly here, and their waste pollutes our rivers and streams.  Land is a whole lot cheaper and easier to come by in China, and they don't tend to pack them as densely as they do here.  So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people, and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can, I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing, and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However, they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point, and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.<br /><br />So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking, the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog, a Golden Retriever, he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could, and not think twice about doing it again the next day."

After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.<br /><br />I've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I won't buy the teabags again."
3004,B002RRLZQW,A1Z2RS261JPFQ2,ducky,1330992000,"great coffee, but not the flavor Im looking for for ca phe sua da","Im not a coffee connoisseur at all and cant tell the difference between harbucks or mcdowels, but I do know the taste of ca phe sua da in socal and have been casually engaged in finding the right blend.  The oft recommended, Cafe du Monde, is definitely not the flavor.  Im not sure what chicory is, but its a funny tasting coffee, fairly mild, and no matter how long I try to filter it to get it stronger/darker, the coffee just isnt the right amount of blackness.  So I turned to Trung Nguyen, and based on recommendations from internet, friends, and the website itself, this is one of (if not the) most popular blend.  Its got a great flavor full of nuttiness and sure presses better than du Monde (almost no grounds at bottom of cup), but its still not the ca phe sua da Im used to.  For one, the color is a definite brown, not black and it isnt strong.  Ill give the Creative #1 a try which says its a dark and strong robusta coffee (no blend), compared to this which is a blend of nearly everything.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a great tasting coffee full of complex flavors that are beyond what I can describe, give this a try... you wont be disappointed to the least.  But, if you are looking for that really strong, jet black coffee that can strip paint off a car and wake up dirt, and that when mixed with condensed milk turns into a rich golden-brown concoction that is ca phe sua da, then you need to look elsewhere (like that Creative #1... possibly)."

And I have tried a LOT...,"I have been buying this Honey for 5 years, since I first was lucky enough to find it in an Organic Grocery Store. I have tried every kind of organic/raw honey brand out there, from the cheapest to the most expensive, and this is by far the best flavor and the best price. Like the other review, I also think of this more as a ""cream"" consistency than as a ""gel"", and it is just heavenly that way. It melts down easy on warm bread or in warm tea, and it is just jam packed with all the flavor and health benefits that have been stripped from all of the runny honey that are filtered inferiors (that are clear in color because of it)that are found at big grocery store chains. If you are lucky enough to find a raw unfiltered honey at a place like that, expect to pay a small forture for it. Go to your local Organic Grocery and you will find a great selection of good honey for a good price, but be prepared, only Y.S Organic Raw Honey is the best and unfortunately it is not commonly found locally, as I have moved several times and have discovered for myself. Amazon has the best prices and the biggest jar sizes I have ever found of this amazing honey, so this is the ONLY place I buy!!! They also have a 22oz size, but sadly it comes in a plastic jar instead of glass, which is just sad since anything stored long term in plastic can ""leech"" chemicals from the plastic into your foods...so I only buy the largest they offer in glass (16oz). If you are debating about trying an Organic/Raw honey, or switching to a new brand, LOOK NO FURTHER. This is one purchase you will NOT regret and you will be a customer for life!!!!"
3043,B001LG945O,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,"Tracy Rowan ""dargelos""",1245715200,"Decent enough, but pricey","The biggest argument I have with Switch is that at a hair under $1 for each 8.3 oz can, it's awfully expensive.  I probably could overlook that if Switch was really, really delicious, but frankly it's not.  The orange-tangerine blend lacks the zip and character of those citrus fruits, particularly tangerine and its delicate sweetness.<br /><br />Instead, there's a heavy taste of the apple-grape combination of juices that forms the fruit base.  There's no added sugar, no high fructose corn syrup or any other sweeteners save the apple and grape concentrates, and that's fine, I'd prefer my juice to not have added sweeteners.  In my opinion, juice doesn't need to be sweetened.  I suspect that the fruit concentrate combo is cheaper than making the drink out of pure citrus juice, so I wonder why it's as expensive as it is.<br /><br />What makes me scratch my head is the notation ""Contains soy.""  What?  Why?  Why on earth put soy in a fruit juice cooler?  Honestly, I'd buy some seltzer or carbonated water of some sort and mix it with my own fruit juice before I'd buy Switch.  But if you'd rather have it pre-made, then by all means give it a try.  It's decent enough, just not my glass of juice."

I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat.

BUT this is the BEST tasting gluten free mix I have ever found.  My kids love them and they are eaten quickly."

Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem.

It felt a lot like a soft drink (that kind of weird filled-up feeling) but lacked pizazz when it came to taste - there wasn't a lot to the strawberry or the kiwi side and just made the drink feel a little flat.  I don't like super sweet foods, but I do like tons of flavor, so the drink didn't impress me too much.

But the Amazon stars say ""I love it"" for 5 stars, ""I like it"" for 4 stars and ""It's okay"" for 3 stars.  So, I give it 3 stars.  I personally felt the coconut flavor was stronger than the chocolate flavor and I'm not a big coconut fan, but I am a chocolate fan.  It wasn't terribly sweet and I rather think I would have liked it a little better if it had been sweeter (but not too sweet - I'm kind of picky that way).  I liked the oats and the ""gluten free""-ness of it.  I don't eat gluten, so that makes bread/bagels pretty expensive.  These worked out best for breakfast, although I think I used it as a going to bed snack a couple of times.<br /><br />So, just for fun, I got some nutritional information from 1) Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip bars 2) some unsalted, dry roasted peanuts and 3) some non-gluten gingersnaps.<br /><br />1) 1, 1.41 oz bar  -had 9g fat, 15 mg cholesterol, 130 mg sodium and 2g of protein.<br />2) 1 oz (40 nuts)  -had 14g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 0mg sodium and 7g protein.<br />3) 5 cookies (30g or 1.06 oz)  -had 6g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 85 mg sodium and 2g protein.<br /><br />I think that each of these snacks might serve at one point or another.

The box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal, so at least 50% of the interior of the box is air. Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60% the length of a ""normal"" snack bar. The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won't be disappointed in the taste of this one.<br /><br />I've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.<br /><br />I really want to like this company. They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. That is why I've continued to try their products. I bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food I've ever had.

I haven't personally tasted Newman's Own Organics new dog treats but they smell way yummier than most dog treats. (My dog Sheila has tasted them and she quickly started groveling for more. It was pathetic.) Seriously, I don't have to taste these to know that they are good. The Newman's Own Corp. and its spin-off Newman's Own Organics have been making quality food for pets and people for almost 30 years. Their organic products are independently certified as organic by Oregon Tilth, a third party certifying agency for organic farmers. Among other things, their certification means that the products used by Newman's Own Organics are grown on farms that do not use artificial pesticides or synthetic chemicals of any kind during the production of their products. In the case of their Lamb & Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, that includes organic, lamb, barley, carrots, apples and molasses.<br /><br />I'm not seriously into organic products myself but there is precious little regulation when it comes to what goes into pet products. I am glad to see that some people take my dog's health seriously.<br /><br />As consumers, we should also remember that Paul Newman and his companies has given over $200 million to charity over the years.

It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: ""Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair."" I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

To have a coffee like this, you have to have a special filter, which I do have.  Honestly, you'll spend a crapload of money on K-cups if you don't get the filter for regular ground coffee.  Anyway, I don't know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way, but the water in my Keurig had a hard time seeping through, causing a bit of an overflow.  Aside from that, the taste was smooth and flavorful.  It has a coffee taste, plain and simple.  Is it anything special, not really.  It just tastes good and is reasonably priced."

They have mostly succeeded.  In the glass, the Switch looks like juice.  It is lightly but distinctly carbonated and easy to drink.  The orange and tangerine flavors are true - none of the ""burn"" of fake orange flavor.  The hit of tangerine is really nice and I greatly enjoyed the flavor.  My problem with the Switch was that it was too sweet for my taste.  I was surprised at the how sweet it was given the advertised ""no added sugar"".  The ingredient list mentions grape and apple juice concentrates.  That's how they get the sugars in without adding sugar.  Fruit juice concentrates are loaded with natural fruit sugars.  The nutritional label tells the story:  the 8.3 oz can has 34 grams of sugar!  That's more than Cocoa Cola (27 grams per 8 oz).  Bottom line - this is just too sweet for me.

These products do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and bran cereals) So if it says ""chicory root"" or ""inulin"" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.

Be warned though, this stuff smells terrible, opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel, but that's how cats like it.<br /><br />Bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality. It has low carbs, low ash/magnesium, high protein, real human grade meat with no by-products, the vitamins/minerals are chelated for better absorption and Petguard has stated they do not use BPA lined cans. Also, contrary to what the ingredient list here on Amazon says it does NOT contain ""Menadione Sodium Bisulfite"" or at least the case I ordered doesn't have any listed, so they must have stopped using it, which is a big plus."

I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine.<br /><br />Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being ""tangy"" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4.<br />I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc.<br /><br />Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star.

It is specifically this brand/packaging, since I was making other varieties of k-cup coffee in the same coffee maker in the same time and none of those broke the seal and left grounds all in the coffee maker.<br />Looking at the seal on this product, compared to other K-cups varieties, this seal is MUCH tighter, and since there is a larger amount of coffee grounds in this k-cup, there's a lot more to make a mess!<br />Loved the taste of the coffee, but can't waste so much time cleaning up the coffee pot!  Don't buy in the Amazon hassle-free packaging, you'll be sorry!"

The only problem we had was with the size of the treats and the hardness of them for dogs that are as old as our two pets.  We did have to break them up into little pieces but then they quickly devoured them, seemingly having no trouble chewing up the pieces.  We did a test by placing their old brand of treats on a plate along with the Lamb and Barley treats; they finished the latter first and were looking for more so I surmised they felt the extra chewing was worth it.  I would definitely recommend these for younger dogs with better chewing power than our 16 and 17-year-old family pets. Anyway, a ""thank you"" from Mopsy and D. J."

3398,B006N3IG4K,A25SQ33WVST1HV,Brant L. Rusch,1327708800,Not a fan of this blend,"Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands."

In addition, it calls for 2/3 cup water or milk. That makes soup. You need maybe half that to get a proper batter consistency. Two stars off for all that.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes...it's exactly as expected. A fair amount of corn-ness, not sweet. I added an egg (there's no obvious binder in the ingredient list) and about a tablespoon of sugar to two packages, and cut back on the milk by roughly half. They rose and browned nicely, and had great texture.<br /><br />While these were fine from a flavor and convenience perspective, I would not buy again, unless the price was drastically lower.

I seriously surround myself with anything rosy!<br /><br />So when I saw this, *rose preserves*, literally preserves made with real rose petals, I couldn't wait to try it. Oh, the wait was incredible! When it finally arrived I didn't even wait for the toaster, I grabbed a spoon and dug right in!<br /><br />It's delicious. Divine. Extraordinary. It feels absolutely indulgent, eating a jam made of roses. It's so romantic and positively Victorian. There couldn't be a daintier dollop for your scones at tea time.<br /><br />So far I've had rose preserves on waffles, toast, ice cream, fresh fruit & yogurt, and coffee cake. I daresay it would even make a unique sweetener for hot tea.<br /><br />Speaking of sweet, that is my one issue. I find these preserves to be really much sweeter than I generally like; I prefer a bit more tartness, even in jams. Don't get me wrong: it's not overpoweringly sweet, there *is* a definite rose flavor in this, and definitely real petals adding unique flavor and texture. I just wish it weren't quite so sweet. But apparently, according to another reviewer who has tried other brands, Kafkas Rose Preserves are the *least* sugary! Any bit sweeter and it would definitely overpower the delicate rose flavor.<br /><br />So, while I can't give it a full 5 stars because I think it's too sweet -  and by the way I sure wish I could only deduct a half star -  I acknowledge that Kafkas Rose Preserves might be the best available. I certainly won't stop putting it on everything and yes, occasionally enjoying a tiny spoonful!<br /><br />I'm going to host a little tea party for my two little nieces and our American Girls dolls (My <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010XH10I"">American Girl Samantha Doll & Paperback Book</a>, Joelle's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZHY3H4"">American Girl Julie Doll and Paperback Book</a>, and Lisey's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZYZAO"">American Girl Kit Kittredge Doll & Paperback Book</a>) and I know the girls will get a kick out of eating jam made of flower petals! I'm also looking forward to my extended family's next brunch, because I will be proudly serving up some rose preserves. In fact, I may be giving out Kafkas Rose Preserves as hostess gifts in lieu of the boring bottles of moscato or prosecco I'm forever dragging to parties. This would be promptly opened and enjoyed, I'm sure of it!<br /><br />If you're a rose lover, or looking for a unique gift, perhaps a cute and clever new spin on ""a bouquet of roses and a box of candy"", I highly recommend these rose preserves!"

3447,B001EPQQL2,A13QM0HT6VXHL5,mean incognito monkey,1350259200,yummy good substitute for brown sugar,"This is a most excellent sugar substitute for those who watch their sugar intake.<br /><br />BUT!!! (and this is important because one does tend to follow recipes to a fault) you must use half as much as the recipe calls for, which btw, does not work as well as you'd hope.  It's just not nearly as sweet cup for cup.<br /><br />I make that up using extra Splenda white because I use brown sugar for it's sweetness as well as the molasses flavor.  This is why I will only give it four stars....because they COULD make it cup for cup by doing what I do and adding more Splenda white so a baker could follow their recipe and not give it a second thought.  Heaven knows they're charging enough for it.<br /><br />I'm sure you know this:  Brown sugar is unrefined or molasses sugar.  You can make your own brown sugar by adding 1 tablespoon unsulfured molasses to 1 cup cane sugar and mixing it with a fork. It comes out nice and fluffy and you can control how much caramel flavor it has.  (and how much extra sugar too)<br /><br />Splenda brown sugar blend as it is, is a very coarsely granulated Splenda, a little coarser than Splenda white.  So the texture is better than what you might mix up on your own.  So for convenience, you can't beat Splenda brown sugar blend.  The Splenda brand is superior (in my opinion) to the store brands that are popping up but YMMV, and your store might have a really good version.<br /><br />Still...and this accounts for a very good four stars you can always count on Splenda, for texture, for flavor and consistency.  When you bake, that counts for a lot in my book."

The prices really are great, and with the Amazon Prime shipping- the overall price truly can't be beaten. I love french roasted coffee- and this does not disappoint. If you do not like the smokey taste, then simply, do not buy any coffee that has the term ""french roast"" on the package!<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect from a Papua New Guinean coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a smokey, chocolate-cream taste. If it were a wine, it would be a Pinotage!<br /><br />Coffee Bean Direct roasts their beans fresh to order. When I purchased the first 5-pounder in February ('11) of the Brazilian French Roast, it had a roasting date of a few weeks earlier in January. On this package that I ordered in June, it also had the roasting date of January. So, it appears that Amazon is selling a large shipment they acquired from them months ago- be informed of that possibility.<br /><br />I have seen many people concerned about the five pounds not staying fresh once opened. Whatever you do- DO NOT REFRIGERATE OR FREEZE- that is some sort of urban legend/myth (lol) and actually speeds up the stale taste!  This is an easy fix!- Do what all coffee distributors do: store in a vacuum-sealed foil package. How? For the five pound bag, you will need about 10 gallon-sized VACUUM food storage bags (found in supermarket) and basic aluminum foil (also in supermarket.)<br /><br />1)Rip off one sheet of aluminum foil about 12-16 inches long<br />2)Lay foil flat on counter<br />3)Gently pour, roughly, 1/2 pound of coffee beans into the center of the foil sheet<br />4)Fold both of the width-side edges neatly over the center of the beans<br />5)Fold the length-side edges neatly over the top and towards the center (much like sloppily wrapping a rectangular present)<br />6)Place this foil package in the vacuum food storage bag- making sure that longer portion of the foil package is put in the bag parallel to the seal of the bag, which would leave much empty space between the foil package and the top of the bag.<br />7)Seal the bag, then vacuum-seal the bag by using the hand pump (can be purchased with the vacuum bags)<br />8)Do this with the remaining coffee beans (leave the amount of beans in the bottom of the coffee bag that you will be using within the next few days)<br />9)Check each plastic bag, by using the pump again to make sure they are vacuum packed.<br />10) Place each bag neatly and carefully either in a box, or a canvas bag (or some sort of storage to keep light out)<br />11) Store in a room temperature closet (about 60-75 degrees F)- making sure the bags will not be moved around too much or dropped as the vacuum seal could break.<br />12) Check the vacuum seal periodically and re-pump if necessary<br />13) This coffee will stay fresh for months this way!<br /><br />May seem like a bit of work, and adds to the cost with the price of the vacuum food storage bags- but, it's worth it!"

But, I have to say, I always feel MISERABLE after eating these cookies.<br />Someone else mentions how they are too sweet, etc etc. I don't think they taste too sweet, and they have 13g of sugar per serving which doesn't seem like it's that much, considering most other 'sweets' have more sugars per serving (take a look at Gatorade, for example).<br />That said, it does seem to be some kind of a reaction to the sugar, because immediately after eating them I feel like my body is dumping into some kind of sugar coma. I start to feel like lead, and lightheaded. They also mess up my tummy. Maybe it's the type of sugar they use? Evaporated cane juice is the 1st ingredient, and they also contain 2 kinds of cellulose, which I think are sugars also (but I could be wrong).<br />Anyhow, I gave 4 stars for taste, because they are THAT good, but keep in mind you may feel like you need a lengthy nap to recover from eating them.<br /><br />I agree with the previous poster they should do *something* about this ... I don't want stevia or artificial sweeteners in them, but maybe try using less sugar, or a different kind of sugar, like organic brown? I have no idea, but I would never let a kid eat more than 1 of these at a time, for fear it'd make them just pass out!<br />I eat other sweet stuff, and nothing makes me feel this bizarrely over-sugared.<br /><br />I'm not even totally sure it's the sugar that makes you feel this way ... any ideas? It's a shame, because they are so delicious. I've tried them several times, and may keep them on hand for a once-in-a-blue-moon craving, but I definitely won't be eating them often."

It felt, looked, and smelled like real peanut butter! The taste is very close...obviously it's not going to taste exactly like real PB, but for the calories you are saving, it's surprisingly on target. Also, when you eat it with other things, as most people do, you don't even notice the difference. I spread it on toast and topped with honey...and it was SO delicious!!!<br /><br />A 45-calorie serving is two tablespoons mixed with one tablespoon of water.

I may be biased because I've loved gummi candies (ESPECIALLY those from Haribo) for pretty much my entire life. There's just something about the perfect combination of texture and bite that make chowing down on chewy fruit-flavored candy a happy activity.<br /><br />Strawberries are one of my favorite fruits so naturally I was overjoyed when I found out many years ago that Haribo made a gummi strawberry candy that, as a bonus, even looked like the fruit it was trying to imitate! They obviously don't taste like actual strawberries which have a sort of tartiness to them, but they do taste as good as if not better than any other imitation strawberry flavor out there.<br /><br />These candies are so good I can just munch on them - two or three at a time - for hours (which I guiltily admit I have done in the past at work). The price can't be beaten, either - believe me, I've looked high and low for a candy specialist that can sell this much sweet goodness at this low a price!<br /><br />And my family loves them as well. My two young boys can't get enough of them, and even my wife who doesn't really like gummi candy all that much can put down a dozen or so pieces.<br /><br />If you like strawberry flavored candy and love gummis, I highly recommend you try this (or even a smaller package if 5 lbs. scares you) - you won't be disappointed!"

You can actually taste Hazelnut in Community Coffee.  It's a bit bolder, but I like a good cup of coffee where you can actually taste the coffee (yeah).  I do not buy or search for Maxwell House any longer, nor do I enjoy Folgers or any of the much more expensive brands as none of them compare to the rich flavor of Community Hazelnut Coffee.

The cats absolutely adore it. I've since found a cat-specific flavor from the same company, but I'll probably use a little of this now and then as variety.<br /><br />The cats' coats look and feel shiny and healthy, and they definitely vomit less than when fed more mainstream foods. I also mixed it with some straight ground raw meat/organs/bone to make sure they were getting plenty of meat. The wild brushtail certainly seems to agree with them as a protein source, and there are precious few protein sources that don't make them sick (I'm limited to chicken, turkey, rabbit, and a small amount of fish usually). Because the brushtail is wild it isn't grain fed, and thus should have plenty of the right nutrients. Also, according to the company, it's an overpopulated nuisance pest, so this is a responsible way to help conserve the forests brushtail devour and the animals that live there. What's not to love?"

So, I recommend this, but I would HIGHLY recommend getting some Chebe too and cutting the Bisquick with it.

Sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are they?<br /><br />I've tried small bags of PopChips from the vending machine (which I recommend doing before you buy a case). I haven't tried all over the flavors until I bought the case and I was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box. Fortunately, my boyfriend and I disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors I don't like and vice versa. It works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually don't have the tastes.

Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!"

But to be honest, not all licorice flavors are done right, and it's one of those flavors that if it's not right, it can be just WRONG.<br /><br />Fortunately, Red Leaf Tea did licorice RIGHT!  This is a strong, crisp, zesty licorice flavor.  It's really an exhilarating flavor.  As I sip it, the aftertaste reminds me very much of Altoid's Liquorice which is the strongest licorice flavored thing I've ever tasted.  This nearly rivals the Altoids in strength ... but this is even better because of the Matcha.  The Matcha offers its creamy consistency and slightly buttery, sweet vegetative tones to the sip, which softens the sharper notes of the licorice in a very appealing way, creating a flavor that reminds me of black Jelly Bellys ... as if someone took black Jelly Bellys and liquified them and stirred them into a bowl of Matcha.<br /><br />It is so good.  If you like black licorice, you should try this.  If you are a black licorice fiend like I am - you've GOT to try this ... this may just be my new favorite source of black licorice flavor, not to mention my new favorite flavored Matcha!"

The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey."

However, nothing really special. I would buy it again if priced right, but probably would not go out of my way to get it, and certainly not at a gourmet price point.

3560,B001LG945O,A8NVUTR71EW0W,"Steven A. Godun ""sgodun""",1246752000,Pricey yet surprisingly refreshing!,"I sampled this product with some reservations. Carbonated fruit juice? My wife said that it would probably be something like Orangina, but since I'm not particularly fond of Orangina that didn't help me much. I then remembered that I had no problem drinking sparkling grape juice so this might not be so bad after all. I sampled this product cold, as warm fruit juice and warm soda are both bad ideas no matter what the flavor.<br /><br />I was very surprised to discover that I enjoyed this quite a bit. I expected there to be some acidity to it, given the orange and tangerine combination, and found none. I did find it surprisingly sweet considering that there's no added sugar. It was not, in fact, entirely unlike your garden variety orange soda with a smoother finish. There was a slight and very brief metallic aftertaste which I first assumed was from drinking it right from the can, but after a second taste from a drinking glass the aftertaste remained. Still, it's not enough to put me off from drinking it.<br /><br />The one thing that did put me off was the price. I'll admit that I'm something of a ""cheap drinker"" - I have a hard time, for example, going to the grocery store and buying a half gallon of lemonade for $2.50 when I can buy a $2 bottle of lemon juice and a $2.50 bag of sugar and make two gallons of lemonade and still have three pounds of sugar left over. I *always* do the math and price out what I'm drinking. (Do you have ANY idea how much money Coke makes off those 20 oz bottles?!?) So for this product, $23 for a 24-pack comes out to 96¢ per 8.3 ounce can, or about 12¢ per ounce. A half gallon of Tropicana orange-tangerine juice at the local supermarket is $3.80, or about 6¢ per ounce. I happen to have a carbonator and chargers are about 40 cents apiece, and it would take 2-3 chargers to do the entire half-gallon, so all said and done it would cost me about 8¢ per ounce to make my own carbonated orange-tangerine drink, so it's about 2/3 the cost to make it myself. (No, I didn't factor in the cost of the carbonator itself so that could be considered loading the dice.)<br /><br />So I guess the bottom line here is, if you're really big on the whole carbonated orange-tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed, or you can make a very close approximation of it yourself for about 65% of the cost (assuming you have a carbonator). Or, you can buy a two liter bottle of house-brand orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about $22 in the process."

So far, so good!"

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured ""food"" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great."

Can not stand the weak blends and only like dark roasts (extra bold).  Used to drink Timothy's Parisian Nights, Midnight Magic and Green Mountains Dark Magic on medium water selection to get a strong enough brew, but now Barista Prima French Roast ONLY, on the large water setting.  Even with extra water it is perfect.  Little pricier than some of the others, but it is worth it, plus I get a full cup of coffee now when I brew on the large water setting.  I should also mention I only use filtered water when I brew my coffee, makes a huge difference.  Filtered water and a Barista Prima French Roast K-cup and it will by far blow everything else out of the water.  Nothing else compares.  If you like a really dark, smooth, flavorful coffee, you must try this.  You will not be disappointed.

However, it did take me a while to figure out the right brewing method, because I found it was much easier to ""scald.""  Might be just me though.  First I boil the water, but whereas usually I just let it sit there for about a minute to cool, here I actually poured it into a pot and let it sit for about 2 or 3 minutes.  Then I grind the beans medium-coarse (it smells heavenly) and 2 tablespoons into the french press it goes.  Pour the water in, and I let it sit for a bit longer than usual, too (still hot though).  I find that it has a very nice... sort of crunchy, hard caramelized sugar finish to it, kind of tastes like the top of a cr&egrave;me brulee.  Delicious.  I drink it black."

I really enjoyed Switch Soda .its something different. Taking juice, putting some carbonation in it. Almost in a vague way reminds me of those sparkling grape juice drinks you get around the holidays if you don't drink wine. Its very good. I would definitely buy it again. However the no sugar added part can be a bit ""misleading"" as you as the label states 33 grams per serving but it's only one serving per can but us diabetics should probably only drink this when we have low sugars like I just did bonus is no high fructose corn syrup which isn't very good anyhow. I liked this and would buy more to keep around the house the days I have my sugar lows as It didn't seem to be to overpowering to me. I liked the kiwi,berry as I am a fan of strawberry and kiwi both. I thought personally it was a very interesting soft drink . I really like this infusion stuff they have these days like Dr pepper put  cherry. chocolate diet one year ago and such. Switch kind if is like that. I personally prefer a fruited flavored carbonated beverage anyhow over say a plain cola type flavored one. I thought this was a change from the regular diet Pepsi and diet sierra mist i am used to drinking .I would pick these up if i seen them in a market or on here someday.  Only con I can really think of at the moment for a case off here its 22 bucks that is kinda steep for the economy were living in right now but if they sold them individual it be easier on the pocket book or pick one up in a store now and then when I see it.

Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, ""100 calorie packs"" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + ""ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS"" & ""ARTIFICIAL COLORS"" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history."

I nice strong burn for about half an hour and the small endorphin rush that follows is a good pickmeup, but, by no means recommended, I'm abit of an idiot at times and have been told in other scenarios that I have no taste buds.<br /><br />lastly, so far as I can figure one drop of this in 8 fluid ounces of liquid will raise it about 300 scovilles. so I assumed 4 drops in a cup of hot chocolate would give me about half a jalapeno. well, I could hardly taste the chocolate and my stomach threatened to chew it's way out alien style.<br /><br />and I just reminded myself that I got some sauce on my finger nearly 5 hours ago because after all that time and various hand washings my eye still burned after scratching it.<br /><br />sorry if that's a little long, but I wanted to add more input to this highly underrated product.<br /><br />and very lastly. if indeed the dropper releases 50 microliters at a time (the best description of the measurement of a drop I could find) then there are well over a thousand drops in this bottle. though I'm not that great at math, so you don't have to take my word for the numbers I give here.<br /><br />happy eating,<br />  Daniel"

I enjoy a Nissin or a Maruchan from time to time, but I know before adding the water that I'm not going to get a healthful snack. For that reason, I don't assess any star penalty for the nutritional transgressions that will be committed when one of these is consumed. They are what they are. You want healthy, eat a salad.<br /><br />Speaking of healthy, the Nongshim bowl proudly proclaims that it has 30% less sodium than their regular product and no MSG. But if you eat the whole thing you'll still be getting about 3/4 of your daily allotment of sodium (assuming a 2000 calorie diet) as well as artificial flavor and the usual cast of chemical names. As I mentioned, you would assume this much unless you just fell off a potato truck.<br /><br />All that said, I just didn't care for the Nongshim very much. I like spicy but I didn't find it all that flavorful beyond the spice heat. My 3-star rating is based solely on that.

Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.

We tried a mid level food (3 stars from Dog Food Reviews) and it did ok, but it was too high in protein for the giant breeds.  When we decided to get a Great Dane this spring I started looking for a food that would be good for both dogs and found this.  We tried it out and after the initial adjustment (necessary with any food) both seem to be doing well on it.  With a giant breed and a large mutt, we go through about 90 lbs a month, so I wanted something affordable but quality and this fits the bill.  In the large 44 lb bags it's usually a bit over a dollar per pound, which is comparable to the big box brands.  We were able to get our Dane to a proper weight on it and keep our mutt from chubbing up too much, so I'm very impressed.

This dog biscuit is everything I look for: no corn, no chemicals, no mysterious ""by-products"". To date, my dog has had no reaction to these biscuits. This is a big deal because the wrong food can give him running sores under his long coat and make him itchy and miserable. NEWMAN'S LAMB AND BARLEY biscuit has an attractive (to me) smell that is reminiscent of  molasses, which is one of the ingredients. Each biscuit has a groove down the middle making it easy to break, so one has a choice to feed the whole biscuit (suitable for a big dog) or only half (for a smaller dog).<br /><br />The dog doesn't go wild for these things, but he does like them.

Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae."

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

However, I do really enjoy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBW50G"">Blue Sky Organic New Century Cola</a> and was curious to try a sugar-free version.  Ultimately, I decided to go with the root beer 'free' soda over a cola because I figured the stronger taste would better cover any strange stevia taste or aftertaste.  I don't buy or consume stevia in other products so I'm not really sure how it tastes on its own, but it's really not bad in this soda.  It also doesn't dry out your mouth like other sweeteners.  This soda definitely has a unique taste but, as another reviewer pointed out, I think you are mostly tasting the ""french sweet birch oil"" per the ingredient list.  It also lists tahitian vanilla, hence the 'creamy' aspect.  The ingredients are quality and while it still has zero nutritional value, it's a better bet over regular or other diet sodas by a long shot.<br /><br />One thing I do not like is the misleading description: yes the soda does contain stevia as a sweetener but it is the second to last ingredient on the list.  The second ingredient out of seven is erythritol, which is a sugar alcohol, and NOT how this product is advertised to be sweetened.  Via wikipedia, it is ""60-70% as sweet as table sugar yet it is almost non-caloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay, and is absorbed by the body, therefore unlikely to cause gastric side effects unlike other sugar alcohols.""  However, I bought this product because I wanted a natural (Stevia leaf) sweetened product rather than another lab-generated chemical.  Disappointed.  I'll probably continue to drink them over time, but will not be reordering.  The stevia content is minimal at best, with the main ingredients being filtered water and erythritol.  I'd rather consume 100 more calories and drink the natural and organic regular Blue Sky cola or root beer.<br /><br />You ARE still consuming an artificially-sweetened-with-chemicals drink!

It turns out that that big green body on this tool is just filled with a spring and a rod, and you can't load it with cheese.  You can only fit enough cheese into a very small chamber for about one olive.  So you have to fill this little chamber with cheese by hand, and then it presses it into the olive.  Then you have to do it all over for your next olive.  You might as well just stuff the olive my hand instead of stuffing the stuffer.  It's kind of a weird concept.

Ferguson ""Two, Daisy, Hannah, and Kitten""",1233360000,best dog treat-- great for training---  all dogs love them,"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs.  They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.  (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency.  It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat.....  not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber.....  not more than 3%<br />-Moisture.....  not more than 6%"

They're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. I usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. They're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). Raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong.<br /><br />I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.<br /><br />I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.<br /><br />PS.

This includes Quaker bars, Luna bars, Cliff bars, Zone bars, etc. So, because I like to change it up, I thought I would give these bars a try, even though they don't carry the protein I am use to.  Additionally, I liked the claim of these bars:  These bars are gluten free, are a good source of fiber, have 9 grams of whole grains per bar, include 180 mg of omega 3 fatty acids, and are sweetened with agave and coconut sugar.<br /><br />The bars themselves come packaged in your usual packaging, and this design is quite attractive as far as designs go.<br /><br />When I saw the bar itself, I was a little skeptical.  It looked more like a moist, waxy, lump of ingredients than the solid ""granola"" bar I was use to.  However, I continued on ahead in the tasting adventure.  Additionally, they are decent sized and the numbers of carbs, sugars, and fat are comparable to smaller bars--so I feel like you are getting more bar to eat than other brands for the same nutritional intake.<br /><br />As far as taste?  I've got to admit.  I was amazed at the taste.  These bars are delicious!  They have more of a fresh quality about them than your usual granola bar.  The combination of the oatmeal and the coconut work well together.  You taste those two flavors over the chocolate.  It's hard to explain---but I give an A + to taste, texture and size.  Texture is very soft and chewy, so easy to eat.  (Other bars have made my jaw ache from chewing).<br /><br />I would purchase these bars again and I'm excited to try additional flavors."

It was 1974 and I was 14 years old. Devastating, I know!<br /><br />As a military brat, service member and spouse, I have looked for genuine Turkish Taffy in nearly every corner of the earth only to discover that the recipe had been sold and then shelved without a single batch being made. I've made several attempts along the way to find something similar but all fell way short of satisfying. Plain salt-water taffy was okay but it was always too soft and airy. Then there was Doscher's French Chew taffy bar that purportedly is as close to Turkish Taffy as it gets. All I can say is, ""ICK!""<br /><br />Now, before we get to the bottom line here you need to know that unlike so many others folks, cracking a Bonomo's was not necessarily an option in FL unless you took it home and stuck it in the fridge for a while (longer than the recommended five minutes). I suppose that might work if you lived next door to the 7-11 but who could wait that long? So, before leaving the store, I would already be peeling back the wrapper on my taffy bar and sinking my teeth in only to find that my teeth would be locked shut in the thick gooey taffy. Mmmm - Heaven!<br /><br />Back in the present, I finally received my box of Bonomo's Vanilla Taffy today - the ONLY flavor worth sinking my teeth into. Unfortunately, there was no way I'd be able to do so. Living in the Blue Ridge Mountains in NC, my taffy had apparently been sitting on a truck stuck in the snow for several days before they finally were able to make it up to our house. To my great disappointment the first bar out of the box was already cracked. I had no choice but to rip open the wrapper like the 14 year old I wish I still were and slip the very first cracked piece ever into my mouth with much anticipation.<br /><br />I was not disappointed!<br /><br />It's funny how the taste of certain foods remain with you, no matter how long it's been since you last had them. Like the original Liege Belgian waffles we used to get in the market a few blocks from our home in Brussels when I was eight years old. I returned to Brussels and that market several times in the late nineties and sure enough - those waffles were just as sweet, sticky with syrup from the partially dissolved ""perle"" sugar.<br /><br />And so it is with the new Bonomo's vanilla flavored Turkish Taffy. Thirty six years later and still, unmistakably genuine Bonomo's Turkish Taffy. Now to find a way to soften it just enough to get my teeth stuck in it again.<br /><br />I am now contemplating whether I should buy several cases of this stuff - enough to last 36 years perhaps. You know, just in case they stop making it again."

If you need coffee for the office where you can't grind fresh, this is better than supermarket coffee (that often includes cheaper Robusta beans) by a long shot  Brew it a bit stronger than recommended to get a full taste.  You can't get it to taste like dark roast by making it stronger - that just makes coffee bitter.  If you want dark roast, buy dark roast.  Medium roast offers pleasures of its own, and can let the individual qualities of coffee come through nicely.<br /><br />Fine grind coffee is meant to made in a filter cone, and this stuff is pleasant and smooth with some personality when done that way.

We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors."

Schrader,1236038400,A Switch for the better?,"I am definitely a mom who wants to limit the amount of ""junk"" food in our home, including sodas, so I was intrigued by a new natural fruit drink with carbonation. We have had other natural carbonated beverages and enjoyed them, but the family would still choose plain old juice or Sunkist soda over any of these when given the choice.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry Switch has had the same reception. The family finds it to be okay, but nothing that will make them trade in their favorites. It is a fruit drink with light carbonation, more natural than most traditional soda, but still just as sugary, even if the sweetness is primarily from natural fruit sugars. Therefore, I find little reason to encourage them to Switch.<br /><br />Its taste reminded me of the old Strawberry Crush from when I was a kid, but not quite a potent. It is pleasant enough, but as my son put it ""I would drink it if it were all that we had in the fridge but I would not ask you to buy it again"". Also, I am not necessarily sure it is  worth the cost of nearly $1 per can (a small can compared to traditional soda).<br /><br />Bottom line: We have tried other natural sodas that we found better tasting and less expensive. It's not bad, so it might be worth a try to see which of the natural brands your family likes best. Don't expect it to replace soft drinks for those in the family that really enjoy them, and don't expect it to be a great, healthy alternative since it is still high in carbs/sugar."

After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.

I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food.""  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).<br /><br />This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess I'll have to wait until she's old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (Virtually impossible for this super-busy and domestically-challenged mom, LOL!)"

This GF option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed<br />with Celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting GF options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals.<br /><br />We have made all types of breakfast items, biscuits, even fried food (chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fried fruit,...)

The odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale. Other people in household tried it and couldn't get past the first cup. Pitched the remainder cups in the trash.

We tried the Twinings Earl Grey tea K-cups and, although the coffee is uniformly great, we had a bit of pessimism whether a Keurig could ""brew"" a good cup of tea.  The Twinings K-cups more than passed the test and have become a favorite in our household.  The tea is brewed just right, flavorful and refreshing.  Twinings (and Keurig) have become a big hit in our home."

I think it has a really crisp, clean taste...with a hint of grassy-ness. The tea particles tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle, if left standing for more than a few minutes, so I have to shake it up periodically. There are times when I feel like I'm drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a lawnmower, but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener. It tastes great when I use stevia, but when I use Sweet & Low...I get a bitter-ish grassy taste."

Wolfgang Puck has the name and the rep.<br /><br />If this were the only Sumatra dark roast on the market, I'd be really happy with it. This is good coffee.<br /><br />It is not outstanding coffee. Compared to Folgers, this product is awesome. Unfortunately for Mr. Puck, I am comparing it to Green Mountain Sumatra.<br /><br />The organic and free trade Sumatra from Green Mountain is better to my taste, and it is cheaper. Mornings are good."

Light and crisp, they're like naked Cheetos, that are actually fairly healthy. They can be topped with most anything, sweet or savory. Great for midnight snacks, afternoon snacks, or crumbled up in tomato soup at lunch or dinner. Wish they'd make them in flavors, they'd beat the pants off most ""diet"" snacks I've ever seen!"
3994,B0045XE32E,A3MFORLOKIOEQY,J. S. Green,1298505600,Dogs love 'em,"I generally buy the Blue Dog bakery dog treats, but I thought I'd try these out. Overall, I like them, and so do my canine family members.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- The dogs really like them.<br />- They are thick and crunchy - the dogs chewed on them for a while, unlike most treats where they were consumed more quickly. I think this is better for their teeth.<br />- Resealable pouch is a nice touch.<br />- Treats have no odor to them, even after handling them to break apart.<br /><br />Con:<br />- The package was a bit difficult to open - it has an indentation to tear, but the first side I tore did not open the bag. I was more careful on the other side, and tore it towards the zipper opening.<br />- The treat come in bunches of two, and since they are pretty thick (over 1/4 inch or so) I found it difficult to split them into individual services. Two would be too much for small dogs. However, if you have a larger animal they might be more appropriate.<br /><br />Summary: A good choice for dog treats. Recommended."

It smells nasty but I think it's just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just won't touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he's REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one."
